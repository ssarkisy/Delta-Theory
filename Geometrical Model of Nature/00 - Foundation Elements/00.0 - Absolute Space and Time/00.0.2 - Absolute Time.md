Absolute time flows uniformly and independently of space and any events within it. It is a one-dimensional continuum, ordered and linear.

### **Mathematical Description**

1.  **Model:** Time is modeled as the real number line:
    $$
    \mathbb{R}
    $$
    A specific instant is represented by a point $t \in \mathbb{R}$.

2.  **Linear Advancement:** Time progresses at a constant rate. The duration (interval) between two instants $t_1$ and $t_2$ is given by the distance:
    $$
    \Delta t = |t_2 - t_1|
    $$

3.  **Forward Direction (Arrow of Time):** The set of all instants is totally ordered. For any two distinct moments $t_1$ and $t_2$, one must precede the other ($t_1 < t_2$ or $t_2 < t_1$). By convention, time advances in the direction of increasing $t$. The "past" corresponds to smaller values of $t$, and the "future" to larger values.

4.  **Absolute Nature:** The time coordinate $t$ is universal. The duration $\Delta t$ between two events is the same for all observers, regardless of their position or motion.
