Absolute 3D Euclidean space is the geometric setting for physical phenomena, independent of time. It is a **static, flat, and non-dynamical** container where events take place. Its geometry is fixed and does not evolve.

A core assumption is that space is **homogeneous and isotropic**:
-   **Homogeneity**: There is no special or central point. Any location is equivalent to any other.
-   **Isotropy**: There is no preferred direction in space.

This implies there is no absolute origin; any chosen origin is merely a convenient reference for a coordinate system.

Hereâ€™s how to define it formally, mirroring the structures in the 4D Euclidean manifold:

### **1. Pure Math (metric space version)**
We model absolute space as the metric space:
$$
\mathbb{R}^3
$$
with coordinates $(x, y, z)$ and the Euclidean distance metric:
$$
d(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q}) = \sqrt{(x_p - x_q)^2 + (y_p - y_q)^2 + (z_p - z_q)^2}.
$$

### **2. Differential Geometry (Riemannian manifold version)**
We define space as the Riemannian manifold:
$$
(\mathbb{R}^3, g)
$$
with the flat metric tensor:
$$
g = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$
This metric has a positive-definite signature $(+, +, +)$.

### **3. Physics-Flavored (index notation)**
Coordinates: $x^i = (x, y, z)$, where the spatial index $i \in \{1,2,3\}$.
Metric:
$$
g_{ij} = \delta_{ij} \quad (\text{the Kronecker delta})
$$
The spatial line element is:
$$
ds^2 = \delta_{ij} \, dx^i dx^j = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$
