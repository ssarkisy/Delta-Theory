We model absolute timespace as a product manifold equipped with Galilean/Newton–Cartan structure, consistent with absolute time and absolute space. The arena is fixed, non-dynamical, homogeneous, and without a privileged origin. Choices of temporal zero and spatial origin are conventions. We deliberately use the term “timespace” to introduce a neoclassical concept and to avoid confusion with relativistic “spacetime.”

### 1. Product Structure (set-theoretic/topological)
We take the background to be the product manifold
$$
\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3,
$$
with coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$. Time is the absolute, globally defined parameter described in 00.0.1 (non-dimensionalized there); we do not combine $dt$ with spatial differentials into a single 4D non-degenerate metric.

Simultaneity slices are
$$
\Sigma_t = \{t\} \times \mathbb{R}^3,
$$
each diffeomorphic to $\mathbb{R}^3$.

### 2. Newton–Cartan data (kinematic structure)
The kinematic structure is given by:
- Absolute clock 1-form
$$
\tau = dt \quad (\text{nowhere-vanishing}).
$$
- Spatial metric on the kernel of $\tau$ (the simultaneity slices). In Cartesian coordinates,
$$
h = dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2, \quad h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}, \quad i,j \in \{1,2,3\}.
$$
- No non-degenerate 4D metric on $\mathcal{M}$. The pair $(\tau, h)$ defines the background geometry.
- A flat, torsion-free connection $\nabla$ compatible with the structure,
$$
\nabla \tau = 0, \qquad \nabla h = 0.
$$
In global inertial coordinates, the connection coefficients vanish and spatial geodesics within each $\Sigma_t$ are straight lines.

Each slice $(\Sigma_t, h)$ carries the usual Euclidean geometry of absolute space (00.0.2). Plain language: we separate a universal clock from the rulers on each “snapshot” of space; think of a flipbook of 3D spaces indexed by $t$, and we never rotate time into space.

### 3. Kinematics and paths
A worldline is a map
$$
x: I \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3, \quad t \mapsto x(t),
$$
with $t$ increasing (time orientation). The velocity and acceleration are
$$
v(t) = \frac{dx}{dt}, \qquad a(t) = \frac{dv}{dt}.
$$
There is no 4D path length mixing $t$ and $x^i$; spatial lengths and durations are measured separately by $h$ and $\tau$. Plain language: a worldline is just the trail of a moving dot through successive instants; speed is distance-over-time $dx/dt$, and we avoid any 4D “arc length” that would mix apples (space) with oranges (time). When we say “length of a path,” we mean the spatial arclength
$L[x; t_1, t_2] = \int_{t_1}^{t_2} \|v(t)\|\, dt$.

---

### 4. Symmetry group (Galilean group)
The kinematic symmetry group is the Galilean group, preserving $\tau$, $h$, and the foliation $t=\text{const}$:
- Time translations: $t' = t + t_0$
- Spatial translations and rotations: $x' = R\,x + a$, with $R \in SO(3)$
- Galilean boosts: $x' = R\,x + v\, t + a$, $t' = t + t_0$

Equivalently, the group combines time translations $\mathbb{R}$, spatial translations $\mathbb{R}^3$, rotations $SO(3)$, and boosts $\mathbb{R}^3$ in the standard semidirect-product structure.

---

### 5. Coordinates and frames
- Any two Cartesian frames within a slice $\Sigma_t$ related by $E(3)$ are equivalent.
- Allowed coordinate transformations preserve the foliation by constant-$t$ hypersurfaces (no rotations mixing $t$ with $x^i$).

---

### 6. Measures and spatial operators
Time is measured by $\tau = dt$. The spatial volume element on each slice is
$$
dV = dx\,dy\,dz.
$$
For field theories/PDEs defined on $\Sigma_t$, the Euclidean Laplacian is
$$
\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2 = \delta^{ij}\,\partial_i \partial_j.
$$
A natural spacetime measure for integration is $dt\, dV$. In plain language: to compute a total amount over time and space, add up over space first, then add those totals over time (or vice versa).

Units and distances. We do not define a 4D distance mixing $t$ and $x^i$. Durations are measured by the absolute clock $\tau=dt$ and spatial distances within each slice by the Euclidean metric $h_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$. If one needs to compare time and length scales, fix a spatial scale $L_0$ and the time scale $T_0$ (see 00.0.1), which induces a characteristic speed $v_0=L_0/T_0$. By default we avoid such identifications; analyses use $\tau$ and $h$ separately.

### 7. Relation to relativistic descriptions
For comparison, relativistic models employ a Lorentzian metric on a 4D manifold, leading to lightcones and a universal speed $c$. In our neoclassical model, the background remains Newton–Cartan with absolute time; any Einstein-like phenomenology is emergent from scalable assemblies on this fixed background, not from curvature of the background itself.
