This document defines the **4D Euclidean timespace** that serves as the fixed, non-dynamical arena for our model. It is the mathematical combination of absolute 3D space and absolute time, forming a static background upon which physical phenomena and their dynamics (e.g., paths, worldlines) unfold. Timespace is a vessel through which point objects and potential emissions travel

A key property of this Euclidean timespace is its **homogeneity**. There is no privileged origin point $(t, x, y, z) = (0, 0, 0, 0)$. The choice of origin is purely a matter of convention for setting up a coordinate system. This implies that the arena has no beginning in time and no central point in space; it is eternal and infinite.

Hereâ€™s how to define this timespace in different levels of formality:

---

### **1. Pure Math (metric space version)**  
We model Euclidean time and space as  
$$
\mathbb{R}^4
$$  
with coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$ and metric  
$$
d(\boldsymbol{p}, \boldsymbol{q}) = \sqrt{(t_p - t_q)^2 + (x_p - x_q)^2 + (y_p - y_q)^2 + (z_p - z_q)^2}.
$$  

A **continuous path** is a continuous map  
$$
\gamma: \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^4, \quad s \mapsto (t(s), x(s), y(s), z(s))
$$  
where $s$ is a parameter (could be arc length, proper time, or just a dummy variable).  

---

### **2. Differential Geometry (Riemannian manifold version)**  
We define the manifold  
$$
(\mathbb{R}^4, g)
$$  
with  
$$
g = dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$  
(a flat, positive-definite metric â€” *Euclidean signature*).  

A **path** is a smooth curve  
$$
\gamma(s) \in \mathbb{R}^4
$$  
with tangent vector  
$$
\dot{\gamma}^a(s) = \frac{d x^a}{ds}, \quad a \in \{0,1,2,3\}
$$  
where $x^0 = t$, $x^1 = x$, etc.  

The **length** of the path is  
$$
L = \int \sqrt{g_{ab} \, \dot{\gamma}^a(s) \, \dot{\gamma}^b(s)} \ ds.
$$  

---

### **3. Physics-Flavored (index notation)**  
Coordinates: $x^\mu = (t, x, y, z)$, $\mu \in \{0,1,2,3\}$  
Metric:  
$$
g_{\mu\nu} = \delta_{\mu\nu}
$$  
Line element:  
$$
ds^2 = \delta_{\mu\nu} \, dx^\mu dx^\nu = dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$  
Path:  
$$
x^\mu = x^\mu(s), \quad \frac{dx^\mu}{ds} \ \text{continuous}.
$$  

---

ðŸ’¡ In **relativity**, youâ€™d swap the Euclidean metric for the **Minkowski metric**. 
$$
ds^2 = -c^2 dt^2 + dx^2 + dy^2 + dz^2
$$  
However, in the neoclassical model timespace is flat and it is permeated by scalable assemblies that behave as described by Einstein's spacetime.
