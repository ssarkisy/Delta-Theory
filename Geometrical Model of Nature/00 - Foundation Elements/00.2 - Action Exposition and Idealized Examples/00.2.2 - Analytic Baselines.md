# 00.2.2 — Analytic Baselines (central 1/r² reference)

Purpose:
- Establish closed-form “Kepler-like” baselines by removing delay and emitter-speed modulation, yielding central inverse-square problems with exact solutions.
- Use these as reference solutions for perturbation about the canonical delayed law.

Models:
- Fixed-center inverse-square (test particle):
  - Equation: a(r) = −K/r² r̂ with constant K>0 (attraction).
  - Closed forms: radial fall, escape, and bound orbits; energy and angular momentum invariants.
- Equal-mass two-body reduction (instantaneous central model):
  - Relative-coordinate reduction; central force on the separation vector; Kepler conics.

Comparisons to canonical law:
- Delay breaks centrality and exact conservation of the Kepler invariants.
- Small-β expansion (|v| ≪ 1): leading-order dynamics match the central baseline; corrections scale with β and curvature.

Deliverables:
- Baseline formulas (energies, periods, conics) for reference.
- Mapping notes: how to translate baseline parameters to canonical notation (κ, ε, charges).

Plain language: First solve the easy, central 1/r² problems exactly; then treat the real, delayed law as a small correction where appropriate.
