# Walkthrough Step 11 — (Removed) Emitter-speed modulation

This step is deprecated. The canonical law no longer includes emitter-speed dimming; the per-hit contribution is
$
\mathbf{a}_{o′\leftarrow j}(t;t_0)=\kappa\,\sigma_{q_j q_{o′}}\,
\frac{|q_j q_{o′}|}{r^2}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}
$
independent of emitter speed. All references to $f(\beta)$ and $q_{\mathrm{eff}}$ have been removed throughout the documentation. Calibration uses $\kappa$, $\epsilon$, and $\eta$ only.

Plain language: We no longer dim pushes by how fast the emitter was moving; each wavefront has the same amplitude.
