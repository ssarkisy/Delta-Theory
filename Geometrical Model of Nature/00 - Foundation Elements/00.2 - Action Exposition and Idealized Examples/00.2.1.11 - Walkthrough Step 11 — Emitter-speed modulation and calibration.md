# Walkthrough Step 11 — Emitter-speed modulation and calibration

Purpose: Collect and formalize the rationale, options, and calibration strategy for the emitter-speed dimming factor f(|v|) that scales the per-wavefront amplitude. This supplements the canonical law without changing its radial-only, delayed character.

1) What dimming is and our default choice

- Canonical per-hit law (v=1 units):
  $$
  \mathbf{a}_{o′\leftarrow j}(t;t_0)=\kappa\,\sigma_{q_j q_{o′}}\,
  \frac{|q_j q_{o′}|}{r^2}\,f\big(\|\mathbf{v}_j(t_0)\|\big)\,\hat{\mathbf{r}},
  $$
  with the default
  $$
  f(\beta)=\frac{1}{1+\beta},\quad \beta=\frac{\|\mathbf{v}\|}{v}\ \ (\text{so in }v=1\text{ units, }\beta=\|\mathbf{v}\|).
  $$
- Why this f was chosen:
  - Normalization: f(0)=1 (undimmed at rest).
  - Positivity and boundedness: 0 < f ≤ 1 for all |v|.
  - Monotone decreasing with |v| (faster emitters dim more).
  - Smooth and algebraically simple; linear small-β behavior $f=1-\beta+O(\beta^2)$.
  - Scale-free in v=1 units; no extra parameters needed.
  - Benign at the $\beta=1$ self-interaction threshold: $f(1)=1/2$.

Plain language: We dim each wavefront by a speed-dependent factor that is 1 at rest and smoothly decreases with speed; the simplest such choice is 1/(1+|v|).

2) Quick calculation at field speed

- At $\beta_{\text{em}}=1$ (i.e., $|v_{\text{em}}|=v$; with $v=1$, $|v_{\text{em}}|=1$):
  $$
  f(1)=\frac{1}{1+1}=\frac{1}{2},\qquad
  |\mathbf{a}|=\frac{\kappa\,|q_j q_{o′}|}{2\,r^2}.
  $$
- Ratio to rest case:
  $$
  \frac{|\mathbf{a}(|v|=1)|}{|\mathbf{a}(|v|=0)|}=\frac{1/2}{1}= \frac{1}{2}.
  $$
- Dimensional variant (v_field ≠ 1): with β=|v_em|/v_field and f(β)=1/(1+β), we again get f(1)=1/2 at |v_em|=v_field.

Plain language: At field speed, each hit is exactly half as strong as at rest, all else equal.

3) Inference geometry: level sets at fixed observed magnitude

For a fixed observed per-hit magnitude A at the receiver, the canonical form reads
$$
A \propto \frac{f(\beta_{\text{em}})}{r^2},\qquad \beta_{\text{em}}=\frac{\|\mathbf{v}_{\text{em}}\|}{v}.
$$
Therefore the distance–speed pairs that are consistent with the same A satisfy
$$
r \;\propto\; \sqrt{\,f(\beta_{\text{em}})\,}.
$$
- Default f gives
  $$
  r \propto \frac{1}{\sqrt{\,1+\beta_{\text{em}}\,}},
  $$
  which matches the relation used in Action.md.
- Interpretation on the unoriented line of action: faster candidate emitters must lie closer on one of the two open rays to yield the same A.

Plain language: Keeping the push size the same, faster emitters must be closer; the exact tradeoff follows the square root of the dimming factor.

4) The dimming curve is a modeling choice (constraints and alternatives)

Constraints to keep the model well-posed and numerically stable:
- C1 Normalization at rest: f(0)=1.
- C2 Positivity and boundedness: $0 < f(\beta) \le 1$ for all $\beta$.
- C3 Monotone decreasing in $\beta$.
- C4 Smoothness (≥ C¹) to mesh with η-regularization.
- C5 High-speed decay: f(|v|)→0 as |v|→∞.
- C6 Dimensionless in v=1 units (or written with an explicit speed scale).

Viable alternative families (examples):
- Rational: $f(\beta)=1/(1+\alpha\,\beta^n)$ with $\alpha>0$, $n\ge 1$.
  - $n=1$ recovers the default ($\alpha=1$); $\alpha$ tunes the slope at $\beta=0$.
  - n=2 yields even-in-velocity damping; small-β starts at O(β²).
- Root-Lorentz-like: $f(\beta)=1/\sqrt{\,1+\alpha\,\beta^2\,}$ (gentler mid-speed damping).
- Exponential: $f(\beta)=\exp(-\alpha\,\beta)$ or $\exp\!\big(-( \beta/\beta_0)^2\big)$ (strong tails).
Each option preserves the radial-only, delayed structure; only weights change.

5) How to calibrate f (principled criteria)

Choose a parametric family $f(\beta;\theta)$ and determine $\theta$ by one or more of:
- Binaries (scale selection): enforce existence and reasonableness of the smallest stable orbit (d₀) and fastest natural frequency (2π/t₀) in the symmetric binary (10.0.1).
- Energy consistency: with mollified shells Φ_η, minimize secular work–energy drift across representative motions (e.g., near the |v|=1 switch).
- Phenomenology targets: fit corridor strengths (photon-like trains), precession rates in near-Kepler orbits (00.2.3.3), and shielding levels in cores.
- Regularity margins: prefer θ that maximizes numerical stability (bounded Lipschitz constants for forces) under both event-aware and mollified integration.

Implementation note: The canonical law is written with $f$ in the numerator; setting $f(\beta)=1/(1+\beta)$ reproduces the current equations. Other choices simply substitute a different $f$.

---

6) Summary

- Default: $f(\beta)=1/(1+\beta)$ is a minimal, stable dimmer with clear small-β behavior and $f(1)=1/2$.
- General inference: for fixed observed magnitude, $r \propto \sqrt{f(\beta_{\text{em}})}$, so faster emitters are closer on the same two open rays.
- Next steps: treat $f$ as configurable $f(\beta;\theta)$, document $\theta$, and calibrate via binary scales, energy consistency, and phenomenology.

Plain language: The exact shape of the dimming curve isn’t ordained; we picked the simplest one that behaves well. If evidence suggests a different shape, we can swap it in and tune it without changing the rest of the framework.
