# 00.2.3.3 — Small-Eccentricity Orbit — Kepler vs Delay

Setup:
- Near-circular motion in an attractive field; compare Kepler baseline to canonical delayed law.
- Use small eccentricity e ≪ 1 and slow-motion (β ≪ 1) assumptions.

Objectives:
- Baseline orbital period, radius, and precession (Kepler: none).
- Leading-order precession and energy drift induced by delay and emitter-only modulation.

Baseline (central 1/r² reference):
- Kepler circular orbit: v² = K/r, ω² = K/r³, no per-orbit precession; small-e expansions known in closed form.

Canonical delayed-law corrections:
- Non-centrality from aiming at the past position introduces a small tangential component.
- Perturbative method: average over one period; compute secular drift terms (precession rate δω, radius correction δr, energy leakage scales with modulation).

Deliverables:
- Baseline formulas (ω, v, E) and first-order correction scaffolding.
- Checklist for numerical comparison over many orbits with η-mollification.

Plain language: Start from a perfect circle (Kepler), then add delay to see a slow precession and tiny energy drift that the ideal central model lacks.
