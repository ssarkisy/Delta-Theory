# 00.2.3.0 — Opposite Charges From Rest at Large Separation

Setup:
- Two Architrinos with charges q1=−ε and q2=+ε.
- Initial velocities v1≈0, v2≈0; initial separation r0 ≫ 1 (in v=1 units).
- Use emitter-only modulation; no receiver-speed modulation.

Objectives:
- Early-time inward acceleration profile.
- Time-to-reach given separation r(t) in the slow-motion regime.
- Deviation from central baseline due to delay.

Baseline (central 1/r² reference):
- Instantaneous central model yields radial fall with closed-form energy relation and time-of-fall integrals.
- Symmetric two-body reduction to relative coordinate with central attraction.

Canonical delayed-law considerations:
- Delay breaks centrality; line of action points to past partner position, introducing a small tangential component that sustains angular momentum growth from asymmetries.
- Leading-order small-β (|v| ≪ 1) expansion:
  - Per-hit amplitude ≈ κ ε² / r² (up to sign).
  - Corrections scale with β and curvature of worldlines; estimate accumulated phase lag over Δt.

Deliverables:
- Formula list from the baseline radial fall for quick comparison.
- Asymptotic estimates: earliest-time r(t) ≈ r0 − (1/2) a0 t² with a0 = κ ε² / r0², plus first corrections from delay.
- Numerical test sketch to validate asymptotics against the event-driven model.

Plain language: Start very far apart and nearly at rest—at first it looks like simple 1/r² attraction; as speeds pick up, delay adds a small sideways effect that the central model doesn’t have.
