# 00.2.4 — Asymptotic Regimes and Perturbations

Regimes:
- Slow motion (β = |v| ≪ 1):
  - Canonical law ≈ central 1/r² + O(β) delay corrections.
  - Emitter-only dimming factor ≈ 1 − β + O(β²).
- Far field (r ≫ characteristic scale):
  - Multipole suppression; superposition favors local sources; use sampling/multipole approximations.
- High-frequency sources (oscillatory motion):
  - Average over cycles; derive effective corridors and radiation-like patterns without cross products.

Methods:
- Multiple-scales averaging over fast orbital times.
- Small-parameter expansions (β, η, curvature radius ratios).
- Secular term tracking to estimate long-time drifts (e.g., precession).

Deliverables:
- Catalog of approximations with validity conditions.
- Bridges from exact baselines to practical estimates under the canonical delayed law.

Plain language: Identify when the delayed law looks almost central, and use small parameters to get simple formulas with known error bars.
