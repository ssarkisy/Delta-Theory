# Walkthrough Step 3 — Causal set and delay geometry

Existing text excerpt (from 00.1.4 - Action.md):
> -   **Causal Interaction Set:** The receiver $o'$ at time $t$ interacts with a source $o$ through the (possibly multi-valued) set of causal emission times
>     $$
>     \mathcal{C}_o(t) = \big\{\, t' \le t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| = (t - t') \,\big\}.
>     $$
>     For $|\mathbf{v}_o(t')| < 1$ locally, $\mathcal{C}_o(t)$ is generically a singleton; for $|\mathbf{v}_o|\ge 1$ it may contain multiple solutions (including self-hits when $o'=o$).

Detailed explanation (geometry of delay and roots):

- Root condition as a light-sphere intersection:
  - Define $F(t'; t) \equiv \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| - (t - t')$ (with $v=1$ units). Causal roots satisfy $F(t'; t)=0$ with $t' \le t$ and $H(t-t')$.
  - Geometrically: the source point $\mathbf{s}_o(t')$ must lie on the sphere of radius $\tau = t - t'$ centered at the receiver’s current position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$.

- Local uniqueness (sub-field-speed, transverse crossing):
  - If the source speed is locally sub-field-speed ($\|\mathbf{v}_o(t')\|<1$) and the derivative $\partial_{t'}F(t';t) = -\hat{\mathbf{r}}\!\cdot\!\mathbf{v}_o(t') + 1$ is nonzero at the root, then the implicit function theorem guarantees a unique, smooth root branch near $t$.
  - Intuition: the expanding “light-sphere” intersects the moving source path transversely.

- Multiple roots (super-field-speed or curved paths):
  - When $\|\mathbf{v}_o\|\ge 1$, the source path can outpace recent shells, allowing several distinct historical points to satisfy the same distance–time constraint (multi-hit regime).
  - Even with $\|\mathbf{v}_o\|<1$, sufficiently curved or oscillatory motion can produce multiple intersections (e.g., loops that cross the same sphere).

- Conventions at singular cases:
  - We adopt $H(0)=0$ so the instantaneous emission at $t'=t$ does not produce an immediate self-kick.
  - Exact center hits ($r=0$ with $t>t'$) contribute no directional acceleration (symmetry; measure zero).

Plain language: You only feel pushes from those earlier moments of a source that lie exactly on the “now-sphere” around you. Usually there’s just one such moment; if the source is very fast or its path loops around, there can be several.
