# Walkthrough Step 9 — Informational ambiguity

Existing text excerpt:
> ### **Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver**
> From the perspective of the receiving Architrino, the information carried by an intersecting potential sphere is limited. The receiver only knows two things:
> 1.  The net strength of the potential at the point of intersection.
> 2.  The radial direction from which the potential arrived (i.e., the vector pointing back to the emission point).

Detailed explanation (degeneracies and inference limits):

- Many-to-one mapping:
  - Different combinations of source identity, charge magnitudes, distances, and emitter speeds can yield the same instantaneous hit magnitude and direction at the receiver.

- Sign ambiguity across a line:
  - Attraction from a positive charge on one side is indistinguishable, at an instant, from repulsion by a negative charge located at the diametrically opposite point along the same line.

- Consequence for reconstruction:
  - Instantaneous local data at the receiver are insufficient to invert for sources. Only over time—using path-history consistency (changing $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, varying $r$, sequences of hits)—can partial reconstruction be attempted.

Plain language: A hit tells you how hard and from which direction you’re being pushed—but not who pushed you or how far away they are. Many different source stories can fit the same momentary shove.
