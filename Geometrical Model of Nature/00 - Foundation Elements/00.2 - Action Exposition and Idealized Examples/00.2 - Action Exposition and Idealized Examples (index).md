# 00.2 — Action Exposition and Idealized Examples (index)

Purpose: Collect clear expositions of the action law and a library of idealized, analytically tractable examples. This chapter complements the canonical specification (00.1.4 — Action) by providing derivations, limits, and worked scenarios.

Assumptions:
- Background is absolute time × Euclidean space; we non-dimensionalize to v=1.
- Canonical per-hit law is purely radial with emitter-only speed modulation.
- Geometric normalizations are absorbed into κ.

Structure:
- 00.2.1 — Exposition (walkthroughs index)
- 00.2.2 — Analytic baselines (central 1/r² reference models)
- 00.2.3 — Idealized examples (worked scenarios)
  - 00.2.3.0 — Opposite charges from rest at large separation
  - 00.2.3.1 — Radial fall to fixed center (test particle)
  - 00.2.3.2 — Equal-charge symmetric repulsion
  - 00.2.3.3 — Small-eccentricity orbit — Kepler vs delay
- 00.2.4 — Asymptotic regimes and perturbations
- 00.2.5 — Numerical cross-checks

Plain language: This is the “worked-examples” chapter for the action law—what it says, where closed forms exist, and how to approximate the rest.
