# 00.2.3.2 — Equal-Charge Symmetric Repulsion

Setup:
- Two identical charges (e.g., q1=q2=+ε) placed at separation r0 with v1=v2=0 and symmetry about the midpoint.
- Motion is radially outward by symmetry in the central baseline.

Objectives:
- Outward acceleration profile and asymptotic behavior v(r) as r→∞.
- Time-to-double separation.

Baseline (central 1/r² reference):
- Relative-coordinate reduction with repulsive central force K/r².
- Energy integral yields v(r) and t(r) in closed form; asymptotics v→√(2E) as r→∞ if E>0.

Canonical delayed-law notes:
- Delay introduces mild non-centrality if symmetry is perturbed.

Deliverables:
- Closed-form central-model expressions for quick comparison.
- Asymptotic series for large r.
- Guidance for numerical verification under small symmetry-breaking perturbations.

Plain language: Same-charge push-apart is the time-reverse of a fall—central theory is exact and gives clean timing to compare with delay-modified runs.
