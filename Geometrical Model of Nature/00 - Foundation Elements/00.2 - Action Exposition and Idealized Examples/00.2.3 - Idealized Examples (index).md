# 00.2.3 — Idealized Examples (index)

Goal: Curate solvable or asymptotically tractable scenarios that illuminate the action law. Each example states assumptions, objectives, baseline (closed-form if available), and how delay/modulation alter results.

Examples:
- 00.2.3.0 — Opposite charges from rest at large separation
  - Early-time, slow-motion regime; compare to central radial fall baseline.
- 00.2.3.1 — Radial fall to fixed center (test particle)
  - Exact in central model; serves as a closed-form benchmark.
- 00.2.3.2 — Equal-charge symmetric repulsion
  - Time-reverse of radial fall; outward motion and asymptotics.
- 00.2.3.3 — Small-eccentricity orbit — Kepler vs delay
  - Near-circular baseline with perturbative delay corrections.

Method pattern (for each example):
- Assumptions and setup
- Objective observables
- Baseline (central 1/r²) solution
- Canonical delayed-law corrections (qualitative + leading-order where possible)
- Numerical testbed outline

Plain language: Pick clean cases, solve the simplest version exactly, then layer in the geometry of delay and speed-dimming to see what changes.
