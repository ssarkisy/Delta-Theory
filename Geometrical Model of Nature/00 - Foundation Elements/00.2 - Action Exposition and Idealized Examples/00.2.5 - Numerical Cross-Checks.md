# 00.2.5 — Numerical Cross-Checks

Purpose:
- Provide a standard recipe for validating analytic baselines and perturbative predictions against simulations of the canonical delayed law.

Recipe:
- Root finding: solve F(t₀; t)=‖s′(t)−s(t₀)‖−(t−t₀)=0 for all sources (v=1 units), discard by H(0)=0; handle r=0 by symmetry.
- Per-hit accumulation: a_{o′←o}(t; t₀)=κ σ |q q′|/(r² (1+‖v_o(t₀)‖)) r̂; sum over all roots and sources.
- Time stepping:
  - Impulsive mode (events): update velocities at hit times (bounded-variation velocities).
  - Mollified mode (δ→δ_η): integrate with standard ODE solvers; choose η small vs local scales.

Validation targets:
- Match to analytic baselines in slow-motion/near-central regimes (Sections 00.2.2 and 00.2.3).
- Measure secular drifts predicted by perturbations (00.2.4).
- Invariants over resolved windows (work–energy with Φ_η).

Outputs:
- Error metrics vs. closed forms (periods, precession rates, timing to reach r thresholds).
- Convergence with respect to η and timestep.

Plain language: Use a consistent numerical playbook to check formulas: find causal hits, add the radial pushes with emitter-dimming, and compare against the simple closed-form cases where those exist.
