# Action and Interaction — Walkthrough (Step 4: Master equation of motion)

Detailed explanation (terms and conventions):

- Direction and sign:
  - $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ points from the source’s historical position $\mathbf{s}_o(t')$ to the receiver’s current position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$.
  - $\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}=\mathrm{sign}(q_o q_{o'})$ selects repulsion for like charges and attraction for unlike.

- Scaling and normalization:
  - The per-hit magnitude falls as $1/r^2$ (surface density on spheres). All geometric constants (e.g., $1/(4\pi)$ and any Jacobians like $1/v$) are absorbed into $\kappa$ by convention.

- Velocity modulation (emitter-only):
  - Only the emitter’s speed at emission, $\|\mathbf{v}_o(t')\|$, dims the per-wavefront amplitude via $1/(1+\|\mathbf{v}_o(t')\|)$.
  - The receiver’s velocity does not change the instantaneous force magnitude; it only affects power through $\mathbf{a}\cdot\mathbf{v}$ (see Step 5).

- Superposition:
  - Total acceleration is the sum over all sources and all causal roots (linearity at the level of shells).

Plain language: For each earlier emission that can reach you now, push straight along the line back to where it came from, with strength set by the charges, the inverse-square distance, and how fast the source was moving when it emitted.
