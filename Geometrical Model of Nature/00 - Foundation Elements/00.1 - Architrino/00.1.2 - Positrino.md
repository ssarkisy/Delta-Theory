The Positrino is the antiparticle of the Electrino, modeled as an Architrino with a positive elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Positrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a positive charge, `q = +\epsilon`.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude `q` is set to `+\epsilon`. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of positive potential, with a surface density that decreases as `1/r^2`.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

A Positrino, located at position `$\mathbf{s}_p(t)$`, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos).

-   **Interaction Condition:** The Positrino experiences an acceleration when it intersects the spherical wavefront emitted by a source particle `j` at an earlier time `t_j`. This occurs at time `t` if the delayed condition is met:
    $$
    \|\mathbf{s}_p(t) - \mathbf{s}_j\| = v(t - t_j)
    $$
    where `$\mathbf{s}_j$` is the position of the source particle at the time of emission.

-   **Acceleration Vector:** The acceleration `$\mathbf{a}_p$` is directed along the unit vector `$\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp} = (\mathbf{s}_p - \mathbf{s}_j) / \|\mathbf{s}_p - \mathbf{s}_j\|` connecting the source to the Positrino. The direction of the acceleration follows the laws of electrostatics:
    -   **Attraction:** When intersecting a **negative potential sphere** (from an Electrino), the Positrino accelerates **towards** the source's origin.
        $$
        \mathbf{a}_p \propto -\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp}
        $$
    -   **Repulsion:** When intersecting a **positive potential sphere** (from another Positrino), the Positrino accelerates **away** from the source's origin.
        $$
        \mathbf{a}_p \propto +\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp}
        $$

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.
