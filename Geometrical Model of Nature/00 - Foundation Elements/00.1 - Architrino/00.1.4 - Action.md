# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: an acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field.

Geodesics and dynamics: In a flat, non-dynamical background, geodesics are straight and do not encode forces; accelerations arise solely from fields and assemblies on this fixed background.

### **Units and constants**
-   We choose units with field speed $v=1$ (select $L_0,T_0$ so $v=L_0/T_0=1$); all speeds are hence dimensionless.
-   $\kappa>0$ is the universal coupling constant controlling interaction strength.
-   $\eta>0$ is the default shell thickness for regularization.

Symbols:
-   $v=1$ (field speed by units), $\kappa>0$ (coupling), $\eta>0$ (shell thickness)
-   $\epsilon>0$ (unit charge magnitude); Electrino $q=-\epsilon$, Positrino $q=+\epsilon$
-   $\sigma_{q q'}=\mathrm{sign}(q\,q')\in\{+1,-1\}$
-   $r=\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t')\|$, $\;\hat{\mathbf{r}}=(\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)-\mathbf{s}_o(t'))/r$

### **Fundamental Interaction**

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ generated by a source object $o$ at an earlier time $t'$. This delayed interaction is the sole mechanism of force in the model.

-   **Causal Interaction Set:** The receiver $o'$ at time $t$ interacts with a source $o$ through the (possibly multi-valued) set of causal emission times
    $$
    \mathcal{C}_o(t) = \big\{\, t' \le t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| = (t - t') \,\big\}.
    $$
    For $|\mathbf{v}_o(t')| < 1$ locally, $\mathcal{C}_o(t)$ is generically a singleton; for $|\mathbf{v}_o|\ge 1$ it may contain multiple solutions (including self-hits when $o'=o$). In plain language: this set collects all earlier moments of the source that can send a sphere to arrive exactly “now” at the receiver’s current location.

-   **Master Equation of Motion (canonical):** For each $t' \in \mathcal{C}_o(t)$, define
    $$
    \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')}{\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\|}, \quad r = \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\|.
    $$
    The signed, purely radial contribution is
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t') = \kappa\,\sigma_{q_o q_{o'}}\,\frac{|q_o q_{o'}|}{r^2}\,\frac{1}{\big(1+|\mathbf{v}_o(t')|\big)\big(1+|\mathbf{v}_{o'}(t)|\big)}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}.
    $$
    No magnetic/right-hand-rule terms appear; there are no cross products or velocity-direction couplings—only radial action along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. The total acceleration superposes over all sources and causal times:
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{o'}(t) = \sum_{o}\ \sum_{t'\in \mathcal{C}_o(t)} \mathbf{a}_{o'\leftarrow o}(t; t').
    $$

    Conventions and exclusions:
    - Heaviside convention $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-force).
    - Exact center hits ($r=0$ with $t>t'$) yield no net directional acceleration (symmetry; measure-zero).
    - Regularization uses the shell $\delta(r-\tau)\to\delta_\eta(r-\tau)$ when continuous-time dynamics are needed.

    Two-body checks (stationary sources):
    - Like charges ($\sigma=+1$): repulsion along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
    - Unlike charges ($\sigma=-1$): attraction along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
    - Stationary source: symmetry implies purely radial action; no tangential component.

    In plain language: for each qualifying earlier emission, draw the line from where it was emitted to where the receiver is now, push along that line with a strength set by the charges, both objects’ speeds, and a $1/r^2$ falloff, then add up all such pushes.

### **Well-posedness and Regularization**
The surface–delta shells yield impulsive forces at isolated hit times. One may treat the dynamics as a measure-driven ODE in $t$ (with velocity of bounded variation), or regularize by replacing the surface delta with a narrow shell of thickness $\varepsilon$,
$$
\delta(r - \tau)\ \longrightarrow\ \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\eta}\,\exp\!\Big(-\frac{(r - \tau)^2}{2\eta^2}\Big),
$$
while preserving total emission $q_{\text{eff}}$. This produces continuous-in-time forces and classical $C^1$ solutions for $\mathbf{s}(t)$ given $C^1$ initial data. In the super-field-speed regime ($|\mathbf{v}_a|>1$), multiple self-roots can occur; summing over all causal times with an integrable regularization ensures finite total impulse. In plain English: the ideal model gives instantaneous “kicks”; the $\eta$-thickening turns them into brief, smooth pushes so standard ODE methods apply.

### **Core Principles**

-   **Superposition:** The potential fields from all sources superpose linearly. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:
    $$
    \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i
    $$
    The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the accelerations from all intersecting potential spheres.

-   **Velocity Dependence:** The dynamics are velocity-dependent. Architrinos are transceivers: they emit potential spheres at a constant cadence; only the per-wavefront amplitude is modulated by the emitter’s speed, and the receiver’s response is likewise modulated by its speed. Self-interaction arises when the causal set $\,\mathcal{C}_a(t)\,$ for $o'=o$ is nonempty; this can occur when $|\mathbf{v}_a| \ge v$ at some past time or due to curvature of the path allowing previously emitted shells to re-intersect the worldline.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect a potential sphere that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an Architrino’s speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures. In plain English: like a fast boat catching its own wake after turning, an Architrino can run into its earlier spheres and get a push away from its past positions.

### **Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver**

From the perspective of the receiving Architrino, the information carried by an intersecting potential sphere is limited. The receiver only knows two things:
1.  The net strength of the potential at the point of intersection.
2.  The radial direction from which the potential arrived (i.e., the vector pointing back to the emission point).

It does not have direct knowledge of the source's identity, distance, or velocity. Because the magnitude of an emission is modulated by the emitter's velocity, a single received potential could have multiple possible origins. For example, a weak negative potential arriving along a specific radial could be from a nearby, fast-moving Electrino or a distant, slow-moving one.

This creates a more profound ambiguity: the receiver cannot distinguish between a negative potential from an Electrino on one side and a positive potential from a Positrino on the opposite side. An acceleration *towards* a point on the radial could be interpreted as attraction to a Positrino at that point, or repulsion from an Electrino located at the diametrically opposite point on the same line.

This ambiguity is compounded by superposition. The net potential at any instant is the sum of all intersecting spheres. A measured potential along a single radial could be the result of a complex confluence of fields from many different emitters located along that line of action, arriving from both directions.
