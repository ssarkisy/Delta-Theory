# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: an acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field.

### **Fundamental Interaction**

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ generated by a source object $o$ at an earlier time $t'$. This delayed interaction is the sole mechanism of force in the model.

-   **Interaction Condition:** The interaction occurs if the particle's position lies on the spherical wavefront emitted by the source:
    $$
    \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| = v(t - t')
    $$
    where $\mathbf{s}_o(t')$ is the historical position of the source at the time of emission.

-   **Force and Potential:** The force $\mathbf{F}$ experienced by the particle is proportional to the gradient of the potential it intersects. Since the potential is a spherical shell, the gradient is radial, and the force is directed along the line connecting the source's past position to the particle's current position:
    $$
    \mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \Phi \quad \text{along the vector } \mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')
    $$
    The direction (attractive or repulsive) depends on the charges of the interacting particles.

### **Core Principles**

-   **Superposition:** The potential fields from all sources superpose linearly. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:
    $$
    \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i
    $$
    The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the accelerations from all intersecting potential spheres.

-   **Velocity Dependence:** The dynamics are velocity-dependent. The strength of an emitted potential sphere is modulated by the **emitter's** velocity, and the action on the **receiver** is also modulated by its velocity. Furthermore, a particle's ability to interact with its own field is determined by whether its speed exceeds the field speed.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect a potential sphere that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an architrino's speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle is moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.

### **Informational Ambiguity at the Receiver**

From the perspective of the receiving Architrino, the information carried by an intersecting potential sphere is limited. The receiver only knows two things:
1.  The net strength of the potential at the point of intersection.
2.  The radial direction from which the potential arrived (i.e., the vector pointing back to the emission point).

It does not have direct knowledge of the source's identity, distance, or velocity. Because the magnitude of an emission is modulated by the emitter's velocity, a single received potential could have multiple possible origins. For example, a weak negative potential arriving along a specific radial could be from a nearby, fast-moving Electrino or a distant, slow-moving one.

This creates a more profound ambiguity: the receiver cannot distinguish between a negative potential from an Electrino on one side and a positive potential from a Positrino on the opposite side. An acceleration *towards* a point on the radial could be interpreted as attraction to a Positrino at that point, or repulsion from an Electrino located at the diametrically opposite point on the same line.

This ambiguity is compounded by superposition. The net potential at any instant is the sum of all intersecting spheres. A measured potential along a single radial could be the result of a complex confluence of fields from many different emitters located along that line of action, arriving from both directions.
