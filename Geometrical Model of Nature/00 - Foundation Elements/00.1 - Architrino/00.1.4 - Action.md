# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: an acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field.

### **Fundamental Interaction**

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ at position $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ generated by a source object $o$ at an earlier time $t'$. This delayed interaction is the sole mechanism of force in the model.

-   **Interaction Condition:** The interaction occurs if the particle's position lies on the spherical wavefront emitted by the source:
    $$
    \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| = v(t - t')
    $$
    where $\mathbf{s}_o(t')$ is the historical position of the source at the time of emission.

-   **Force and Potential:** The force $\mathbf{F}$ experienced by the particle is proportional to the gradient of the potential it intersects. Since the potential is a spherical shell, the gradient is radial, and the force is directed along the line connecting the source's past position to the particle's current position:
    $$
    \mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \Phi \quad \text{along the vector } \mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')
    $$
    The direction (attractive or repulsive) depends on the charges of the interacting particles.

### **Core Principles**

-   **Superposition:** The potential fields from all sources superpose linearly. The net potential at any point is the sum of the individual potentials:
    $$
    \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i
    $$
    The total acceleration on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the accelerations from all intersecting potential spheres.

-   **Velocity Dependence:** The dynamics are velocity-dependent. The strength of an emitted potential sphere is modulated by the emitter's velocity. Furthermore, a particle's ability to interact with its own field is determined by whether its speed exceeds the field speed.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect a potential sphere that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an architrino's speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle is moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.
