# Action and Interaction — Walkthrough (Step 1)

Existing text excerpt (from 00.1.4 - Action.md):
> The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: an acceleration caused by the intersection of its path with a potential field.
>
> Geodesics and dynamics: In a flat, non-dynamical background, geodesics are straight and do not encode forces; accelerations arise solely from fields and assemblies on this fixed background.

Detailed explanation (dynamical geometry):

- Background kinematics (Newton–Cartan/Galilean):
  - The arena is absolute time × Euclidean space, $\mathcal{M}=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3$, with simultaneity slices $\Sigma_t=\{t\}\times\mathbb{R}^3$ carrying the flat spatial metric $h_{ij}=\delta_{ij}$.
  - “Geodesics are straight” means: in the absence of any interaction, a worldline $\mathbf{s}(t)$ satisfies $\mathbf{a}(t)=d^2\mathbf{s}/dt^2=\mathbf{0}$; motion is uniform and rectilinear in each slice $\Sigma_t$. The background is fixed; there is no curvature to encode forces.

- Field geometry as expanding spherical shells:
  - Each Architrino emits potential on razor-thin spherical shells that expand at field speed $v$ (non-dimensionalized to $v=1$ elsewhere). The field is distribution-valued, supported on $r=v(t-t_0)$ around the historical emission point $\mathbf{s}(t_0)$, with surface density $\propto 1/r^2$.
  - “Potential field” here is not a static scalar on space; it is a time-indexed family of spherical wavefronts whose superposition defines the instantaneous environment at a receiver’s location.

- Intersection as the event that causes acceleration:
  - The receiver Architrino follows a continuous path (worldline) $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$. An “intersection” occurs at time $t$ when $\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t)$ lies on one of the source’s expanding shells. Equivalently, there exists an emission time $t'\le t$ such that the geometric condition
    $
    \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\| = v(t - t')
    $
    holds. This identifies a causal hit from source $o$’s past to the receiver’s present.
  - At such an intersection, the model applies a purely radial acceleration impulse directed along the line of action
    $
    \hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')}{\|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_o(t')\|}.
    $
    No right-hand-rule or cross-product terms appear; the action is collinear with $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.

- “Simple action” in precise terms:
  - The dynamical law is event-driven by shell intersections: the receiver’s acceleration is the superposition of per-hit radial contributions, each scaled by a $1/r^2$ law and speed-modulation factors (introduced later). Between hits (in the $\eta\to 0$ idealization), motion is inertial; with mollification ($\eta>0$) the impulses smear into brief, smooth pushes.
  - The background contributes no force; all deviations from straight-line motion are entirely due to these intersection events with fields emitted by other Architrinos (and, when kinematically allowed, with the receiver’s own past emissions).

- Physical picture:
  - Imagine countless expanding spherical “skins of influence.” The Architrino feels a push only when one of those skins reaches it. The push is straight along the radius from the emission point to the receiver’s current location, with strength declining as $1/r^2$ and modulated by source/receiver speeds.

If you’d like to continue, the next item to unpack is “Units and constants” (the $v=1$ convention, coupling $\kappa$, and regularization width $\eta$) and then the formal definition of the causal interaction set $\mathcal{C}_o(t).
