The Electrino is a fundamental particle modeled as an Architrino with a negative elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Electrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a negative charge, $q = -\epsilon$.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude $q$ is set to $-\epsilon$. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of negative potential, with a surface density that decreases as $1/r^2$.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

An Electrino, located at position $\mathbf{s}_e(t)$, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos).

-   **Interaction Condition:** The Electrino experiences an acceleration when it intersects the spherical wavefront emitted by a source particle $j$ at an earlier time $t_j$. This occurs at time $t$ if the delayed condition is met:
    $$
    \|\mathbf{s}_e(t) - \mathbf{s}_j\| = v(t - t_j)
    $$
    where $\mathbf{s}_j$ is the position of the source particle at the time of emission.

-   **Acceleration Vector:** The acceleration $\mathbf{a}_e$ is directed along the unit vector $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je} = (\mathbf{s}_e - \mathbf{s}_j) / \|\mathbf{s}_e - \mathbf{s}_j\|$ connecting the source to the Electrino. The direction of the acceleration follows the laws of electrostatics:
    -   **Attraction:** When intersecting a **positive potential sphere** (from a Positrino), the Electrino accelerates **towards** the source's origin.
        $$
        \mathbf{a}_e \propto -\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je}
        $$
    -   **Repulsion:** When intersecting a **negative potential sphere** (from another Electrino), the Electrino accelerates **away** from the source's origin.
        $$
        \mathbf{a}_e \propto +\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je}
        $$

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

### **3. Path**

The Electrino follows the general path dynamics described for the Architrino. Its path is the set of historical positions:
$$
\mathcal{P}_e = \{ \mathbf{s}_e(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Its future trajectory is determined by its current state $(\mathbf{s}_e, \mathbf{v}_e)$ and the superposition of accelerations from all intersecting fields, as detailed in its interaction dynamics.
