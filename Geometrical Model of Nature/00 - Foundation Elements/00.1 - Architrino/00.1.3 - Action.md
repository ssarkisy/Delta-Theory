# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action: it experiences an acceleration when it intersects a potential sphere. This is the fundamental mechanism of interaction in the model.

### **Interaction Condition**

An Architrino experiences an acceleration at time $t$ if and only if its position $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$ lies on the surface of a spherical wavefront emitted by a source particle $j$ at some earlier time $t_j$. This delayed condition is met if:
$$
\|\mathbf{s}_a(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_j)\| = v(t - t_j)
$$
where $\mathbf{s}_j(t_j)$ is the historical position of the source particle at the time of emission, and $v$ is the field speed.

The resulting acceleration vector is directed along the line connecting the source's past position to the Architrino's current position. The magnitude and direction (attractive or repulsive) are determined by the charges of the interacting particles, as defined for the Electrino and Positrino.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect a potential sphere that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an architrino's speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle is moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.
