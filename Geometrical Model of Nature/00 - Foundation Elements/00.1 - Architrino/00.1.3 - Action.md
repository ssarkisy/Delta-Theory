# Action and Interaction

The dynamics of an Architrino are governed by a simple action that has four key properties:

-   **Trigger Condition:** Action occurs when a point object intersects a potential sphere. This is the sole mechanism of interaction.
-   **Direction of Force:** The resulting force (and acceleration) is directed along the line connecting the receiving particle's current position to the source particle's historical emission point.
-   **Superposition:** The total action on a particle at any instant is the vector sum of the actions from all intersecting potential spheres from all sources, including itself.
-   **Velocity Dependence:** The dynamics are velocity-dependent. The strength of an emitted potential sphere is modulated by the emitter's velocity. Furthermore, a particle's ability to interact with its own field is determined by whether its speed exceeds the field speed.

The fundamental mechanism of this action is an acceleration experienced by the particle.

### **Interaction Condition**

An Architrino experiences an acceleration at time $t$ if and only if its position $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$ lies on the surface of a spherical wavefront emitted by a source particle $j$ at some earlier time $t_j$. This delayed condition is met if:
$$
\|\mathbf{s}_a(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_j)\| = v(t - t_j)
$$
where $\mathbf{s}_j(t_j)$ is the historical position of the source particle at the time of emission, and $v$ is the field speed.

The resulting acceleration vector is directed along the line connecting the source's past position to the Architrino's current position. The magnitude and direction (attractive or repulsive) are determined by the charges of the interacting particles, as defined for the Electrino and Positrino.

### **Self-Interaction**

A crucial dynamic arises from the possibility of self-interaction. An Architrino can intersect a potential sphere that it emitted itself at an earlier point in its history. Self-interaction can occur when an architrino's speed has exceeded field speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$). In this regime, the particle is moves ahead of previously emitted wavefronts, allowing it to interact with its own field. This self-interaction is always repulsive and plays a key role in the stability of emergent structures.
