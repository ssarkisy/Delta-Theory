The Positrino is the antiparticle of the Electrino, modeled as an Architrino with a positive elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Positrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a positive charge, $q = +\epsilon$.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude $q$ is set to $+\epsilon$. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of positive potential, with a surface density that decreases as $1/r^2$.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

A Positrino, located at position $\mathbf{s}_p(t)$, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos). In this flat, non-dynamical background, free motion is straight-line and constant-velocity; any deviation is due to fields and assemblies, not background curvature.

-   **Causal Interaction:** Use the Master Equation of Motion defined in 00.1.4 Action and Interaction. We work in units with field speed $v=1$. For the Positrino with $q_p=+\epsilon$, each causal contribution from a source $j$ is purely radial along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp}$, with like charges repelling and unlike charges attracting. The strength is modulated by both emitter and receiver speeds via the factor $1/\big((1+|\mathbf{v}_j|)(1+|\mathbf{v}_p|)\big)$. The net acceleration sums over all $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$ and over all sources $j$.

    Plain language: you accelerate along the line back to the emission point; like charges push you away, unlike charges pull you in, and both sidesâ€™ speeds dim the push. This modulation does not change the emission cadence: Architrinos emit at a constant rate; only per-wavefront amplitude and receiver response are speed-modulated.

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

### **3. Path**

The Positrino follows the general path dynamics described in the main Architrino Path document. Its path is the set of historical positions:
$$
\mathcal{P}_p = \{ \mathbf{s}_p(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Its future trajectory is determined by its current state $(\mathbf{s}_p, \mathbf{v}_p)$ and the superposition of accelerations from all intersecting fields.
