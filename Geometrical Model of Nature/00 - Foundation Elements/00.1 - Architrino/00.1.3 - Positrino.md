The Positrino is the antiparticle of the Electrino, modeled as an Architrino with a positive elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Positrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a positive charge, $q = +\epsilon$.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude $q$ is set to $+\epsilon$. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of positive potential, with a surface density that decreases as $1/r^2$.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

A Positrino, located at position $\mathbf{s}_p(t)$, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos). In this flat, non-dynamical background, free motion is straight-line and constant-velocity; any deviation is due to fields and assemblies, not background curvature.

-   **Causal Interaction:** At time $t$, define the causal set of emission times from source $j$
    $$
    \mathcal{C}_j(t) = \big\{\, t_0 \le t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_p(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\| = v\,(t - t_0) \,\big\}.
    $$
    For each $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$, let $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp}(t_0) = (\mathbf{s}_p(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0))/\|\mathbf{s}_p(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\|$. The signed acceleration contribution is
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{p\leftarrow j}(t; t_0) = \sigma_{q_j q_p}\,A_{j,p}(t,t_0)\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{jp}(t_0),
    $$
    where $\sigma_{q_j q_p}=+1$ for like charges (repulsion) and $-1$ for unlike charges (attraction), and $A_{j,p}$ encodes the emitterâ€™s effective charge $q_{\text{eff},j}(t_0)$, any receiver-side velocity modulation, and the $1/r^2$ geometric scaling on the shell. The net acceleration sums over all $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$ and over all sources $j$.

    Plain language: you accelerate along the line from the past emission point to your current location; like charges push you away, unlike charges pull you in, and the total effect is the sum of all such contributions that can arrive now.

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

### **3. Path**

The Positrino follows the general path dynamics described in the main Architrino Path document. Its path is the set of historical positions:
$$
\mathcal{P}_p = \{ \mathbf{s}_p(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Its future trajectory is determined by its current state $(\mathbf{s}_p, \mathbf{v}_p)$ and the superposition of accelerations from all intersecting fields.
