The Electrino is a fundamental particle modeled as an Architrino with a negative elementary charge.

### **1. Geometric and Field Properties**

-   **Type:** The Electrino is an instance of the Architrino geometry.
-   **Charge:** It carries a negative charge, $q = -\epsilon$.
-   **Emission:** It generates a field identical to the Architrino's, where the magnitude $q$ is set to $-\epsilon$. This field propagates outward as an expanding spherical shell of negative potential, with a surface density that decreases as $1/r^2$.

### **2. Interaction Dynamics (Equation of Motion)**

An Electrino, located at position $\mathbf{s}_e(t)$, is a point particle that moves in response to the potential fields generated by other source particles (Electrinos or Positrinos). In this flat, non-dynamical background, free motion is straight-line and constant-velocity; any deviation is due to fields and assemblies, not background curvature.

-   **Causal Interaction:** At time $t$, define the causal set of emission times from source $j$
    $$
    \mathcal{C}_j(t) = \big\{\, t_0 \le t \;\big|\; \|\mathbf{s}_e(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\| = v\,(t - t_0) \,\big\}.
    $$
    For each $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$, let $\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je}(t_0) = (\mathbf{s}_e(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0))/\|\mathbf{s}_e(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\|$. The signed acceleration contribution is
    $$
    \mathbf{a}_{e\leftarrow j}(t; t_0) = \sigma_{q_j q_e}\,A_{j,e}(t,t_0)\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{je}(t_0),
    $$
    where $\sigma_{q_j q_e}=+1$ for like charges (repulsion) and $-1$ for unlike charges (attraction), and $A_{j,e}$ encodes the emitter’s effective charge $q_{\text{eff},j}(t_0)$, any receiver-side velocity modulation, and the $1/r^2$ geometric scaling on the shell. The net acceleration sums over all $t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)$ and over all sources $j$.

    Plain language: you are pushed now by every earlier sphere that can just reach you; the push points back to where that sphere came from, it’s stronger when you’re closer and when the emitter was “brighter,” and all such pushes add up.

This behavior is consistent with a force law where like charges repel and opposite charges attract.

### **3. Path**

The Electrino follows the general path dynamics described in the main Architrino Path document. Its path is the set of historical positions:
$$
\mathcal{P}_e = \{ \mathbf{s}_e(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
Its future trajectory is determined by its current state $(\mathbf{s}_e, \mathbf{v}_e)$ and the superposition of accelerations from all intersecting fields.
