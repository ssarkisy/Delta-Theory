### Geometric characterization

Consider spacetime $M=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(t,\mathbf{s})$ and Euclidean spatial metric. An emission event at $(t_0,\mathbf{s}_0)$ generates a radially symmetric, measure-valued field supported on the future spherical wavefront
$$
\mathcal{C}=\{(t,\mathbf{s}) : t\ge t_0,\; r = v\,(t-t_0)\},\quad r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|,
$$
where $v$ is the constant field speed. At the emission time $t=t_0$, the field is a spatial Dirac delta of magnitude $q$ located at $\mathbf{s}_0$. At each fixed time $t>t_0$, the field is a surface delta measure on the sphere $S_{r}$ of radius $r=v(t-t_0)$ centered at $\mathbf{s}_0$, normalized so its total mass is $q$.

### Analytic form

Let $\tau=t-t_0$ and $r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|$. The measure-valued density (per unit volume) is
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})
=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau),
$$
where $H$ is the Heaviside step function. Equivalently, using the surface delta $\delta_{S_r}$ (a distribution supported on the sphere $S_r$ with $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\delta_{S_r}\,\mathrm{d}^3s=4\pi r^2$),
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta_{S_{v\tau}}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)\,H(\tau).
$$
- **Support:** $r=v\tau$ and $\tau\ge 0$.
- **Conservation:** $\displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\rho(t,\mathbf{s})\,\mathrm{d}^3s = q$ for all $t>t_0$.
- **Pointwise scaling on the sphere:** the surface density scales as $q/(4\pi r^2)$, giving the stated $1/r^2$ falloff on the expanding sphere.

### Governing conservation law

This field is the delayed, spherically symmetric, measure-valued solution of the radial continuity equation with a point-source impulse:
$$
\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\big(v\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\rho\big) = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0),
\quad \hat{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0}{\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|}.
$$
Equivalently, in radial form,
$$
\partial_t \rho + v\,\partial_r \rho + \frac{2v}{r}\,\rho = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\frac{\delta(r)}{4\pi r^2},
$$
whose delayed solution is $\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\dfrac{q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-v\tau)H(\tau)$.

### Path of an Architrino

As a point particle, an Architrino traces a continuous path (or worldline) through spacetime, denoted by its position vector $\mathbf{s}(t)$. The field described above is generated continuously from every point along this path.

The specific trajectory of this path is determined by the particle's interactions with fields from other particles. These dynamics are defined for specific types of Architrinos, such as the Electrino and Positrino.


### **3. Path and Superposition**

#### **Path**
The **path** of an Architrino is its worldline, the set of points representing its position through time. For any time `t` up to the present moment `$t_{\text{now}}$`, the path is the set:
$$
\mathcal{P}_e = \{ \mathbf{s}_e(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$
where `$\mathbf{s}_e(t)$` is the position vector of the Architrino.

#### **Future Path and Superposition**
The future path (for $t > t_{\text{now}}$) is determined by integrating the equation of motion, using the Architrino's current position `$\mathbf{s}_e(t_{\text{now}})$` and velocity `$\mathbf{v}_e(t_{\text{now}})$` as initial conditions.

The total acceleration on the Architrino at any instant is the vector sum of the individual accelerations caused by each intersecting potential sphere from all other source particles. This is the **principle of superposition**:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{e, \text{total}}(t) = \sum_{j} \mathbf{a}_{e,j}(t)
$$
where `$\mathbf{a}_{e,j}(t)$` is the acceleration induced on the Architrino by the field of source particle `j`. An individual acceleration term is non-zero only if the interaction condition with particle `j` is met at time `t`.
