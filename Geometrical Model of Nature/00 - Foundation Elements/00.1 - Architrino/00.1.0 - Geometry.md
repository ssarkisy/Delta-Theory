### Geometric characterization

Consider timespace $M=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(t,\mathbf{s})$ and Euclidean spatial metric. An emission event at $(t_0,\mathbf{s}_0)$ generates a radially symmetric, measure-valued field supported on the future spherical wavefront
$$
\mathcal{C}=\{(t,\mathbf{s}) : t\ge t_0,\; r = v\,(t-t_0)\},\quad r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|,
$$
where $v$ is the constant field speed. At the emission time $t=t_0$, the field is a spatial Dirac delta of magnitude $q$ located at $\mathbf{s}_0$. At each fixed time $t>t_0$, the field is a surface delta measure on the sphere $S_{r}$ of radius $r=v(t-t_0)$ centered at $\mathbf{s}_0$, normalized so its total mass is $q$.

This expanding wavefront has two key properties:
-   **Indefinite Expansion:** The wavefront expands indefinitely as $t \to \infty$. The radius $r = v(t-t_0)$ grows without bound, and the surface density $q/(4\pi r^2)$ approaches zero but never reaches it.
-   **Non-interaction with Particles:** The field passes through other Architrinos without being altered, absorbed, or scattered. Its sole effect is to impart an acceleration on the particles it intersects.

### Analytic form

Let $\tau=t-t_0$ and $r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|$. The measure-valued density (per unit volume) is
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})
=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau),
$$
where $H$ is the Heaviside step function. Equivalently, using the surface delta $\delta_{S_r}$ (a distribution supported on the sphere $S_r$ with $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\delta_{S_r}\,\mathrm{d}^3s=4\pi r^2$),
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta_{S_{v\tau}}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)\,H(\tau).
$$
- **Support:** $r=v\tau$ and $\tau\ge 0$.
- **Conservation:** $\displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\rho(t,\mathbf{s})\,\mathrm{d}^3s = q$ for all $t>t_0$.
- **Pointwise scaling on the sphere:** the surface density scales as $q/(4\pi r^2)$, giving the stated $1/r^2$ falloff on the expanding sphere.

### Governing conservation law

This field is the delayed, spherically symmetric, measure-valued solution of the radial continuity equation with a point-source impulse:
$$
\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\big(v\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\rho\big) = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0),
\quad \hat{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0}{\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|}.
$$
Equivalently, in radial form,
$$
\partial_t \rho + v\,\partial_r \rho + \frac{2v}{r}\,\rho = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\frac{\delta(r)}{4\pi r^2},
$$
whose delayed solution is $\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\dfrac{q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-v\tau)H(\tau)$.

### Path and Dynamics

As a point particle, an Architrino traces a continuous path (or worldline) through timespace, denoted by its position vector $\mathbf{s}_a(t)$. The field described in the preceding sections is generated continuously from every point along this path.

#### **Path Definition**
The **path** of an Architrino is the set of points representing its position through time. For any time `t` up to the present moment `$t_{\text{now}}$`, the path is the set:
$$
\mathcal{P}_a = \{ \mathbf{s}_a(t) \mid t \le t_{\text{now}} \}
$$

#### **Future Path and Superposition**
The future path (for $t > t_{\text{now}}$) is determined by integrating the equation of motion, using the Architrino's current position `$\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$` and velocity `$\mathbf{v}_a(t_{\text{now}})$` as initial conditions.

The total acceleration on an Architrino at any instant is the vector sum of the individual accelerations caused by each intersecting potential sphere from all other source particles. This is the **principle of superposition**:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{a, \text{total}}(t) = \sum_{j} \mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t)
$$
where `$\mathbf{a}_{a,j}(t)$` is the acceleration induced on the Architrino by the field of source particle `j`. An individual acceleration term is non-zero only if the interaction condition with particle `j` is met at time `t`.

The specific interaction rules that determine the acceleration are defined for subtypes of Architrinos, such as the Electrino and Positrino.

### Advanced Dynamics: Velocity Regimes and Emission

This section details more advanced concepts regarding the Architrino's motion and its field generation.

#### **Velocity Regimes and Local Field Interaction**
The model places no inherent limit on the speed of an Architrino, $|\mathbf{v}_a|$. Its velocity relative to the field speed `v` defines three distinct dynamic regimes. Consider a particle at position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}_a$. At an infinitesimal time $\Delta t$ later, its new position is $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t)$. The wavefront it emitted at $t_{\text{now}}$ has expanded to a radius of $r = v \Delta t$.

-   **Sub-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| < v$):** The particle travels a distance less than the wavefront's radius. It is located *inside* the sphere of its most recent emission, lagging behind it.
-   **Super-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$):** The particle travels a distance greater than the wavefront's radius. It is located *outside* the sphere of its most recent emission, moving ahead of it.
-   **Symmetry Point ($|\mathbf{v}_a| = v$):** The particle travels exactly on the edge of its own expanding wavefront. This represents a critical symmetry-breaking point in its dynamics.

It is important to distinguish this immediate relationship (between $t_{\text{now}}$ and $t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t$) from the possibility of an Architrino intersecting one of its own wavefronts emitted earlier in its path history. This is somewhat analogous to a speedboat passing it's own wake, and later curving or stopping such that it's past wake catches up and passes.

#### **Velocity-Modulated Emission**
While the Architrino emits its field at a constant rate, the strength of the impulse generated at any instant is modulated by its speed. The emission strength is inversely related to the particle's speed, being maximal for a stationary particle and decreasing as speed increases.

To model this without singularities, we define the effective charge magnitude, $q_{eff}$, using a dimensionless factor based on the ratio of the particle's speed to the field speed, $\beta(t_0) = |\mathbf{v}_a(t_0)|/v$. A simple, non-singular model is:
$$
q_{eff}(t_0) = \frac{q}{1 + \beta(t_0)} = \frac{q}{1 + |\mathbf{v}_a(t_0)|/v}
$$
This modifies the governing equations. The source term in the conservation law becomes:
$$
\text{source} = q_{eff}(t_0)\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)
$$
Consequently, the density on the expanding sphere is also scaled by this factor:
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s}) = \frac{q_{eff}(t_0)}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau)
$$
