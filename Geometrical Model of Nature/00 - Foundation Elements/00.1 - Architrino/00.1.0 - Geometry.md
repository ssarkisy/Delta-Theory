### Core Emission Properties

The fundamental action of an Architrino is the continuous emission of a potential field. This process has the following key properties:

-   **Constant Rate of Wavefront Emission:** Each Architrino emits potential wavefronts at a constant rate. The magnitude of the potential carried by each wavefront, however, is modulated by the particle's speed.
-   **Point of Emission:** The potential emerges at the Architrino's current location (radius = 0) at time $t=\text{now}$ as a spatial Dirac delta.
-   **Spherical Expansion:** From its point of emission, the potential expands as a perfectly spherical wavefront.
-   **Field Speed:** The radius of this sphere grows at a constant rate, the field speed $v$.
-   **Surface Density:** The magnitude of the potential is concentrated on the surface of the sphere and decreases as a function of $1/r^2$, where $r$ is the sphere's radius.

### Geometric characterization

Consider timespace $M=\mathbb{R}\times\mathbb{R}^3$ with coordinates $(t,\mathbf{s})$ and Euclidean spatial metric. An emission event at $(t_0,\mathbf{s}_0)$ generates a radially symmetric, measure-valued field supported on the future spherical wavefront
$$
\mathcal{C}=\{(t,\mathbf{s}) : t\ge t_0,\; r = v\,(t-t_0)\},\quad r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|,
$$
where $v$ is the constant field speed. At the emission time $t=t_0$, the field is a spatial Dirac delta of magnitude $q$ located at $\mathbf{s}_0$. At each fixed time $t>t_0$, the field is a surface delta measure on the sphere $S_{r}$ of radius $r=v(t-t_0)$ centered at $\mathbf{s}_0$, normalized so its total mass is $q$.

This expanding wavefront has two key properties:
-   **Indefinite Expansion:** The wavefront expands indefinitely as $t \to \infty$. The radius $r = v(t-t_0)$ grows without bound, and the surface density $q/(4\pi r^2)$ approaches zero but never reaches it.
-   **Non-interaction with Particles:** The field passes through other Architrinos without being altered, absorbed, or scattered. Its sole effect is to impart an acceleration on the particles it intersects.

### Analytic form

Let $\tau=t-t_0$ and $r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|$. The measure-valued density (per unit volume) is
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})
=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau),
$$
where $H$ is the Heaviside step function. Equivalently, using the surface delta $\delta_{S_r}$ (a distribution supported on the sphere $S_r$ with $\int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\delta_{S_r}\,\mathrm{d}^3s=4\pi r^2$),
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta_{S_{v\tau}}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)\,H(\tau).
$$
- **Support:** $r=v\tau$ and $\tau\ge 0$.
- **Conservation:** $\displaystyle \int_{\mathbb{R}^3}\rho(t,\mathbf{s})\,\mathrm{d}^3s = q$ for all $t>t_0$.
- **Pointwise scaling on the sphere:** the surface density scales as $q/(4\pi r^2)$, giving the stated $1/r^2$ falloff on the expanding sphere.

### Governing conservation law

This field is the delayed, spherically symmetric, measure-valued solution of the radial continuity equation with a point-source impulse:
$$
\partial_t \rho + \nabla\cdot\big(v\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}\,\rho\big) = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0),
\quad \hat{\mathbf{r}}=\frac{\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0}{\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|}.
$$
Equivalently, in radial form,
$$
\partial_t \rho + v\,\partial_r \rho + \frac{2v}{r}\,\rho = q\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\frac{\delta(r)}{4\pi r^2},
$$
whose delayed solution is $\rho(t,\mathbf{s})=\dfrac{q}{4\pi r^2}\delta(r-v\tau)H(\tau)$.

### Advanced Dynamics: Velocity Regimes and Emission

This section details more advanced concepts regarding the Architrino's motion and its field generation.

#### **Velocity Regimes and Local Field Interaction**
The model places no inherent limit on the speed of an Architrino, $|\mathbf{v}_a|$. Its velocity relative to the field speed $v$ defines three distinct dynamic regimes. Consider a particle at position $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}})$ moving with velocity $\mathbf{v}_a$. At an infinitesimal time $\Delta t$ later, its new position is $\mathbf{s}_a(t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t)$. The wavefront it emitted at $t_{\text{now}}$ has expanded to a radius of $r = v \Delta t$.

-   **Sub-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| < v$):** The particle travels a distance less than the wavefront's radius. It is located *inside* the sphere of its most recent emission, lagging behind it.
-   **Super-field Speed ($|\mathbf{v}_a| > v$):** The particle travels a distance greater than the wavefront's radius. It is located *outside* the sphere of its most recent emission, moving ahead of it.
-   **Symmetry Point ($|\mathbf{v}_a| = v$):** The particle travels exactly on the edge of its own expanding wavefront. This represents a critical symmetry-breaking point in its dynamics.

It is important to distinguish this immediate relationship (between $t_{\text{now}}$ and $t_{\text{now}} + \Delta t$) from the possibility of an Architrino intersecting one of its own wavefronts emitted earlier in its path history. This is somewhat analogous to a speedboat passing it's own wake, and later curving or stopping such that it's past wake catches up and passes.

#### **Velocity-Modulated Emission**
While an Architrino is a constant rate emitter of potential per unit time, the strength of the impulse generated at any instant is modulated by its speed. The emission strength is inversely related to the particle's speed, being maximal for a stationary particle and decreasing as speed increases.

To model this without singularities, we define the effective charge magnitude, $q_{eff}$, using a dimensionless factor based on the ratio of the particle's speed to the field speed, $\beta(t_0) = |\mathbf{v}_a(t_0)|/v$. A simple, non-singular model is:
$$
q_{eff}(t_0) = \frac{q}{1 + \beta(t_0)} = \frac{q}{1 + |\mathbf{v}_a(t_0)|/v}
$$
This modifies the governing equations. The source term in the conservation law becomes:
$$
\text{source} = q_{eff}(t_0)\,\delta(t-t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)
$$
Consequently, the density on the expanding sphere is also scaled by this factor:
$$
\rho(t,\mathbf{s}) = \frac{q_{eff}(t_0)}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta\!\big(r - v\,\tau\big)\,H(\tau)
$$
