Perfect ‚Äî let‚Äôs build that table!

The **van der Waals volume** $V_{w}$ of a molecule is essentially the ‚Äúhard-sphere‚Äù space it occupies, obtained by summing the volumes of its atoms (using tabulated van der Waals radii) and correcting for bond overlaps. Chemists often report values from Bondi‚Äôs classic data (1964) or later refinements.

Here‚Äôs a table of approximate **van der Waals volumes** for some common molecules, sorted from smallest to larger. (Units: √Ö¬≥ = cubic √•ngstr√∂m, where $1 \,\text{√Ö}^3 = 10^{-24}\,\text{cm}^3$.)

### Notes

* These values come from **Bondi‚Äôs van der Waals radii** and computational chemistry datasets (Reid et al. 1987, Gavezzotti 1983, etc.).
* For molecules, values differ slightly depending on whether they‚Äôre measured (from liquid densities) or calculated (from radii).
* Water looks ‚Äúsmall‚Äù ‚Äî but its *partial molar volume in liquid water* is actually \~18 cm¬≥/mol, quite a bit larger than 55 √Ö¬≥ per molecule would suggest, because of hydrogen bonding and open packing.

---

### 1. **Definition Level: Geometric vs. Effective**

* **Geometric van der Waals volume**
  If you define it *purely from atomic radii* (Bondi radii, tabulated), then the van der Waals volume is considered a **fixed property of the molecule**.

  * It‚Äôs like saying: if atoms are spheres of fixed size, then methane is \~71 √Ö¬≥ no matter what.
  * In this strict sense, **it doesn‚Äôt change with T, P, or environment** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a model parameter.

* **Effective van der Waals / Excluded volume**
  In real systems, the *space a molecule excludes others from* depends on conditions. Neighboring molecules can compress electron clouds, hydrogen bonding can open space, etc. This makes the **effective excluded volume** somewhat flexible.

---

### 2. **Temperature Effects**

* Higher temperature ‚Üí more vibrational and rotational motion ‚Üí molecules explore larger average conformations.
* For flexible molecules (like long hydrocarbons), the **average van der Waals volume can increase** with T because they adopt more extended conformations.
* For rigid small molecules (like H‚ÇÇO, CO‚ÇÇ), the intrinsic atomic radii don‚Äôt change much, but the *effective space they occupy in a liquid* (partial molar volume, packing) does increase with temperature, since liquids expand.

---

### 3. **Pressure Effects**

* At very high pressure, electron clouds are compressed.
* Effective radii shrink slightly (measured by X-ray diffraction in crystals under gigapascal pressures).
* In liquids, increasing pressure reduces the free volume between molecules, so the **apparent excluded volume per molecule decreases**, even if the geometric van der Waals volume is ‚Äúconstant.‚Äù

---

### 4. **Neighbor / Environment Effects**

* **Hydrogen bonding (water, alcohols)** ‚Üí opens up local structure, so molecules ‚Äúoccupy‚Äù more apparent space than their van der Waals radii suggest.
* **Ionic solvation** ‚Üí hydration shells mean ions effectively displace much more volume than their bare VdW size.
* **œÄ‚ÄìœÄ stacking (aromatics)** ‚Üí molecules pack more tightly than spheres would predict, reducing effective excluded volume.

---

### 5. **In Practice**

Chemists often distinguish:

* **van der Waals volume (constant)** ‚Üí derived from tabulated radii.
* **Partial molar volume (variable)** ‚Üí depends on T, P, and composition; this is what you‚Äôd measure experimentally in solutions.
* **Free volume (variable)** ‚Üí governs diffusion and viscosity, strongly T- and P-dependent.

---

‚úÖ **So the short version:**

* *Tabulated VdW volumes* are treated as constants.
* *Effective volumes* (the actual displacement of space in real systems) **do change with temperature, pressure, and molecular environment**.

---

what types of other particles may interlope between maximally packed VdW regions? neutrinos? photons? dark matter? spacetime particles? Higgs? gluons? etc


This is a fun ‚Äúwhere do things fit?‚Äù type of question ‚Äî you‚Äôre essentially asking: *if you take molecules packed together as tightly as van der Waals repulsion allows, what kinds of ‚Äúother particles‚Äù could still pass through those regions of space?*

Let‚Äôs break it down by type of particle or excitation, from everyday physics to more exotic:

---

## 1. **Classical Chemistry/Physics Scale**

* **Electrons** ‚Äì No, because electron clouds *define* the van der Waals boundaries. Any overlap raises energy steeply (Pauli exclusion + Coulomb repulsion).
* **Other atoms/molecules** ‚Äì No, unless high pressure/energy forces them into overlap (like in shock compression or inside neutron stars).

So at ‚Äúnormal‚Äù conditions, van der Waals volumes represent **impenetrable regions for ordinary matter.**

---

## 2. **Photons (Light)**

* Photons don‚Äôt have charge and don‚Äôt obey exclusion like fermions.
* They **can pass through electron clouds** depending on their wavelength and the material‚Äôs transparency:

  * Visible photons pass through transparent substances (like glass or water) without being absorbed strongly.
  * X-rays pass through almost everything except very heavy nuclei (they probe electron density).
  * Gamma rays penetrate deeply ‚Äî they‚Äôre only absorbed probabilistically via scattering or nuclear interactions.

So: **photons interlope freely, unless they resonate or scatter.**

---

## 3. **Neutrinos**

* Neutrinos interact only via the weak force. Their mean free path through matter is *enormous* (light-years of lead to stop them!).
* They don‚Äôt ‚Äúsee‚Äù van der Waals exclusion at all.
* So: **neutrinos pass straight through molecules, electron clouds, and nuclei essentially unhindered.**

---

## 4. **Dark Matter (if it exists in WIMP form)**

* Candidate dark matter particles (WIMPs, axions, etc.) interact very weakly with ordinary matter.
* Like neutrinos, they would not notice van der Waals exclusion volumes.
* Dark matter would just flow through.

---

## 5. **Virtual Particles / Force Carriers**

* **Photons (virtual, EM field)**: define the repulsion itself, so they‚Äôre already ‚Äúin‚Äù the electron cloud structure.
* **Gluons**: confined inside protons and neutrons, never free to wander between molecules.
* **Higgs boson**: an excitation of the Higgs field ‚Äî not something that diffuses between molecules in any practical sense.
* **Gravitons (if they exist)**: like photons for gravity, would pass through unhindered.

---

## 6. **Spacetime ‚ÄúParticles‚Äù**

* If by ‚Äúspacetime particles‚Äù you mean excitations of spacetime (like hypothetical gravitons), they too would **not be blocked** by van der Waals regions.
* In general relativity, spacetime itself isn‚Äôt obstructed ‚Äî the matter just curves it.

---

### üö¶ Bottom Line

* **Blocked**: ordinary fermionic matter (atoms, molecules, electrons).
* **Pass through depending on energy**: photons (visible, X-rays, gamma).
* **Essentially unaffected**: neutrinos, dark matter, gravitational waves, Higgs field excitations, gluons (confined inside hadrons).

---

So the ‚Äúexcluded‚Äù van der Waals volume is really just excluded for **ordinary atoms and electrons**. For most of the universe‚Äôs particles (neutrinos, photons, dark matter, spacetime waves), those boundaries don‚Äôt exist at all.

---

Would you like me to make a **diagram** showing ‚Äúlayers of penetrability‚Äù (like concentric shells: what gets blocked vs what passes through)? That might make this really intuitive.
