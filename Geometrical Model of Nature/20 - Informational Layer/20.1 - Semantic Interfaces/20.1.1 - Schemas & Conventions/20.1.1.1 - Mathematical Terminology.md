# Mathematical Terminology (Canonical Dialect)

This table lists the symbols and mathematical terms used across the Geometrical Model of Nature and explains their meaning in this project’s context.

| Symbol / Term | Meaning in this project |
| --- | --- |
| $\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R} \times \mathbb{R}^3$ | Absolute timespace: global, oriented time × Euclidean 3-space; no non-degenerate 4D metric. |
| $t$ | Absolute time (dimensionless after choosing $T_0$); increases globally. |
| $\Sigma_t$ | Simultaneity slice at time $t$: $\{t\} \times \mathbb{R}^3$. |
| $h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}$ | Euclidean spatial metric on $\Sigma_t$; implements dot products and norms. |
| $\mathbf{x},\, \mathbf{s}$ | Spatial position vectors in $\mathbb{R}^3$; vectors are bold, e.g., $\mathbf{s}(t)$. |
| $\mathbf{v} = d\mathbf{s}/dt,\ \mathbf{a} = d\mathbf{v}/dt$ | Velocity and acceleration vectors (boldface by convention). |
| $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ | Euclidean norm (length) induced by $h_{ij}$. |
| hat (ˆ) | Unit vector; e.g., $\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \mathbf{r}/\lVert\mathbf{r}\rVert$. |
| $v$ (field speed) | Propagation speed of spherical shells; set to $1$ by units ($v=1$). |
| $\kappa > 0$ | Universal coupling constant (absorbs geometric normalizations). |
| $\epsilon > 0$ | Unit charge magnitude; identified with $\lvert e\rvert/6$. |
| $q,\, q'$ | Intrinsic Architrino charges for source and receiver (each equals $\pm\epsilon$). |
| $\sigma_{q q'} = \mathrm{sign}(q\,q')$ | Interaction sign: $+1$ like-on-like (repulsion), $-1$ unlike (attraction). |
| $r,\, \hat{\mathbf{r}}$ | Separation and radial direction from source’s emission position to receiver “now.” |
| $t_0,\ \tau = t - t_0$ | Causal emission time and delay to reception. |
| $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$ | Causal set of emission times of source $j$ that reach the receiver at time $t$. |
| $\delta(r - v\tau),\ \delta_{S_r}$ | Surface delta on expanding shell; surface measure on sphere $S_r$. |
| $\delta_\eta(\cdot)$ | Mollified (Gaussian) shell with width $\eta > 0$ for smooth dynamics. |
| $H(\tau)$ | Heaviside step; convention $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-kick). |
| $\Phi,\ \Phi_\eta$ | Potential and mollified potential from superposed shells. |
| $U = q'\,\Phi_\eta$ | Potential energy at a point (mollified; weak limit as $\eta\to 0$). |
| $\mathbf{F} = -\nabla U$ | Force from the potential (pointwise for $\Phi_\eta$). |
| $a_{o'\leftarrow j}(t; t_0)$ | Per-hit acceleration from source $j$ emitted at $t_0$ (purely radial, $\propto 1/r^2$). |
| $q_{\mathrm{eff}}(t_0) = \dfrac{q}{1+\lvert v_j(t_0)\rvert}$ | Emitter-speed dimmed per-wavefront amplitude; emission cadence is constant. |
| $v_r,\, v_\perp$ | Radial and transverse components of receiver velocity relative to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$. |
| $d_0,\, t_0$ (emergent) | Minimal binary radius and characteristic fastest period from dynamics. |
| $\mathrm{SS}_a(t)$ | “Sphere stream” of worldline $a$ at observation time $t$ (union of all causal spheres). |
| $\beta = \lvert v\rvert/v$ | Dimensionless speed; with $v=1$, $\beta = \lvert v\rvert$. |
| $\Delta$ | Euclidean Laplacian on $\Sigma_t$ ($\Delta = \partial_x^2 + \partial_y^2 + \partial_z^2$). |
| $E(3)$ | Euclidean group of spatial symmetries (translations ⋊ rotations). |
| $c_{\max} \equiv v$ | Maximal signal speed (field speed of shells). |
| EOM | Master Equation of Motion: delayed, purely radial, inverse-square per-hit law. |
| Mollify / Mollification | Replace distributions by smooth approximations, e.g., $\delta\!\to\!\delta_\eta$ (Gaussian of width $\eta$), to obtain $C^1$ trajectories and well-defined $\nabla\Phi_\eta$. |
| Regularize / Regularization | The process of introducing $\eta>0$ (or similar) to control singularities; interpret $\eta\to 0$ in the weak/integrated sense. |
| Normalize / Normalization | Choose constants (e.g., $1/(4\pi r^2)$) and Jacobians so total emission integrates to the source strength $q$; ensures conserved totals. |
| Change of variables (delta) | Identity $\delta(r - v\tau) = \dfrac{1}{v}\,\delta\!\big(\tau - r/v\big)$; the $1/v$ factor is a Jacobian from variable substitution. |
| Non-dimensionalize | Choose $L_0, T_0$ so $v=L_0/T_0=1$; all speeds become dimensionless ratios to $v$. |

Notes:
- Bold symbols denote vectors; hats denote unit vectors; $\lVert\cdot\rVert$ denotes norms.
- All speeds are nondimensional after choosing $L_0, T_0$ so that $v = L_0/T_0 = 1$.
- Assemblies are dynamical geometries of Architrino transceivers (not point particles). Their effective field/wave behavior is the net superposition of their constituent Architrinos evolving under the equation of motion; any “emission/absorption” attributed to an assembly is shorthand for this superposed dynamics.
