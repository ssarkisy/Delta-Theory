 # Mathematical Terminology (Canonical Dialect)

This table lists the symbols and mathematical terms used across the Geometrical Model of Nature and explains their meaning in this project’s context.

| Symbol / Term | Meaning in this project |
| --- | --- |
| 𝓜 = ℝ × ℝ^3 | Absolute timespace: global, oriented time × Euclidean 3-space; no non-degenerate 4D metric. |
| t | Absolute time (dimensionless after choosing T0); increases globally. |
| Σ_t | Simultaneity slice at time t: {t} × ℝ^3. |
| h_{ij} = δ_{ij} | Euclidean spatial metric on Σ_t; implements dot products and norms. |
| x, s | Spatial position vectors in ℝ^3; vectors are bold, e.g., s(t). |
| v = ds/dt, a = dv/dt | Velocity and acceleration vectors (boldface by convention). |
| ‖·‖ | Euclidean norm (length) induced by h_{ij}. |
| ˆ (hat) | Unit vector; e.g., r̂ = r/‖r‖. |
| v (field speed) | Propagation speed of spherical shells; set to 1 by units (v=1). |
| κ > 0 | Universal coupling constant (absorbs geometric normalizations). |
| ε > 0 | Unit charge magnitude; identified with |e|/6. |
| q, q′ | Architrino charges (multiples of ±ε) for source and receiver. |
| σ_{q q′} = sign(q q′) | Interaction sign: +1 like-on-like (repulsion), −1 unlike (attraction). |
| r, r̂ | Separation and radial direction from source’s emission position to receiver “now.” |
| t₀, τ = t − t₀ | Causal emission time and delay to reception. |
| 𝓒_j(t) | Causal set of emission times of source j that reach the receiver at time t. |
| δ(r − vτ), δ_{S_r} | Surface delta on expanding shell; surface measure on sphere S_r. |
| δ_η(·) | Mollified (Gaussian) shell with width η > 0 for smooth dynamics. |
| H(τ) | Heaviside step; convention H(0)=0 (no instantaneous self-kick). |
| Φ, Φ_η | Potential and mollified potential from superposed shells. |
| U = q′ Φ_η | Potential energy at a point (mollified; weak limit as η→0). |
| F = −∇U | Force from the potential (pointwise for Φ_η). |
| a_{o′←j}(t; t₀) | Per-hit acceleration from source j emitted at t₀ (purely radial, ∝ 1/r²). |
| q_eff(t₀) = q/(1+|v_j(t₀)|) | Emitter-speed dimmed per-wavefront amplitude; emission cadence is constant. |
| v_r, v_⊥ | Radial and transverse components of receiver velocity relative to r̂. |
| d₀, t₀ (emergent) | Minimal binary radius and characteristic fastest period from dynamics. |
| SS_a(t) | Sphere stream of worldline a at observation time t (union of all causal spheres). |
| β = |v|/v | Dimensionless speed; with v=1, β=|v|. |
| Δ | Euclidean Laplacian on Σ_t (Δ = ∂²_x + ∂²_y + ∂²_z). |
| E(3) | Euclidean group of spatial symmetries (translations ⋊ rotations). |
| c_max ≡ v | Maximal signal speed (field speed of shells). |
| EOM | Master Equation of Motion: delayed, purely radial, inverse-square per-hit law. |

Notes:
- Bold symbols denote vectors; hats denote unit vectors; ‖·‖ denotes norms.
- All speeds are nondimensional after choosing L0, T0 so that v = L0/T0 = 1.
