# Mathematical Style Guide (Canonical Dialect)

Purpose: Define a single, canonical mathematical and geometrical dialect for the Geometrical Model of Nature. All technical documents should adhere to this guide. Equations are presented in display math for clarity where appropriate.

## 1) Background spaces and sets

- Timespace:
  $$
  \mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}\times \mathbb{R}^3
  $$
  with coordinates $(t, x, y, z)$.
  $$
  \Sigma_t = \{t\}\times \mathbb{R}^3
  $$
  are simultaneity slices (Euclidean 3-space snapshots).
- Vectors and norms:
  - Spatial vectors are bold: $\mathbf{s}, \mathbf{v}, \mathbf{a}$.
  - Unit vectors carry hats: $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.
  - Norms use double bars: $\|\cdot\|$.
- Indices:
  - Components indexed by $\large i, j \in \{1,2,3\}$ with $\large \delta_{ij}$.

Plain language: One global clock t and ordinary 3D space; we write vectors in bold, unit directions with hats, and lengths with double bars.

## 2) Kinematics (Newton‚ÄìCartan/Galilean background)

- Absolute time $t$ is universal and oriented; durations are

  $$
  \Delta t = |\,t_2 - t_1\,|.
  $$

- Space is Euclidean with metric

  $$
  h_{ij} = \delta_{ij}\quad\text{on each slice }\Sigma_t.
  $$
- There is no 4D non-degenerate metric; we do not mix time and space into a single line element.
- Worldlines:
  - $\mathbf{x}: I \subset \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R}^3,\ t \mapsto \mathbf{x}(t)$, absolutely continuous; $\mathbf{v} = d\mathbf{x}/dt$, $\mathbf{a} = d\mathbf{v}/dt$.

Plain language: Objects move as dots in 3D through successive instants; speeds and distances are measured separately from time.

---

## 3) Propagation and causal set (retarded-only)

- Field speed is $v$; by default we non-dimensionalize to $v=1$.
- Retarded-time condition (RT):
  $$
  \tau = t - t_0,\quad r = \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\|,\quad r = v\,\tau
  $$
- Causal set:
  $$
  \mathcal{C}_j(t) = \{\, t_0 \le t \mid \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\| = v\,(t - t_0) \,\}
  $$
- Conventions:
  - $H(0)=0$ (no instantaneous self-kick).
  - Exact center hits $r=0$ with $\tau>0$ yield no directional acceleration (symmetry; measure zero).

Plain language: A push now only happens if a past sphere has had exactly enough time to reach you.

---

## 4) Distributions and regularization (spherical shells)

- Point emission at (t‚ÇÄ, s‚ÇÄ):
  $$
  \text{source} = q\,\delta(t - t_0)\,\delta^{(3)}(\mathbf{s} - \mathbf{s}_0)
  $$
- Expanding shell at speed v:
  $$
  \rho(t,\mathbf{s}) = \frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta(r - v\,\tau)\,H(\tau),\quad r=\|\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0\|,\ \tau=t-t_0
  $$
  $$
  \rho = \frac{q}{4\pi r^2}\,\delta_{S_{v\tau}}(\mathbf{s}-\mathbf{s}_0)\,H(\tau)
  $$
- Regularization:
  $$
  \delta(r - v\,\tau)\ \to\ \delta_\eta(r - v\,\tau) \;=\; \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi}\,\eta}\,\exp\!\Big(\!-\frac{(r - v\,\tau)^2}{2\,\eta^2}\Big)
  $$
  - Use Œ∑ > 0 when differentiability is required; take Œ∑ ‚Üí 0 limits in the weak/integrated sense.

Plain language: Each emission is a razor-thin spherical shell; when needed, we thicken it slightly so calculus works smoothly.

## 5) Master Equation of Motion (EOM; purely radial)

Given a receiver o‚Ä≤ at time t and a source j at retarded time t‚ÇÄ ‚àà ùíû_j(t), let
$$
r = \|\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)\|,\quad
\hat{\mathbf{r}} = \frac{\mathbf{s}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{s}_j(t_0)}{r},\quad
\sigma_{q_j q_{o'}} = \mathrm{sign}(q_j q_{o'}) \in \{+1,-1\}
$$

Canonical per-hit acceleration:
$$
a_{o‚Ä≤\leftarrow j}(t; t_0)
= \kappa\,\sigma_{q_j q_{o‚Ä≤}}\,
\frac{|q_j q_{o‚Ä≤}|}{r^2\,(1 + |v_j(t_0)|)\,(1 + |v_{o‚Ä≤}(t)|)}\,\hat{\mathbf{r}}.
$$

Total acceleration:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{o‚Ä≤}(t) = \sum_{j}\ \sum_{t_0 \in \mathcal{C}_j(t)} a_{o‚Ä≤\leftarrow j}(t; t_0).
$$

Notes:
- Emission cadence is constant; only per-wavefront amplitude and receiver response are speed-modulated.
- No cross products, no right-hand-rule magnetism; every per-hit action is along $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$.

Plain language: For each past emission that can reach you now, push along the line back to where it came from, weaken the push by both sides‚Äô speeds and by 1/r¬≤, then add all pushes.

Receiver velocity decomposition (instantaneous):
- Decompose the receiver velocity relative to $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$:
  $$
  \mathbf{v} = v_r\,\hat{\mathbf{r}} + \mathbf{v}_\perp,\qquad v_r = \mathbf{v}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
  $$
- Because $a_{o‚Ä≤\leftarrow j} \parallel \hat{\mathbf{r}}$, a single hit updates only the radial component:
  $$
  \frac{d}{dt}\mathbf{v}_\perp = 0,\qquad \frac{d}{dt}v_r = a_{o‚Ä≤\leftarrow j}\cdot \hat{\mathbf{r}}
  $$
- Local trend: inward motion ($\large v_r<0$) tends to strengthen subsequent per-hit contributions via the $\large 1/r^2$ factor; outward ($\large v_r>0$) tends to weaken them, all else equal.

Plain language: a hit changes only the along-the-line piece of your velocity right then; sideways motion is unchanged at that instant.

## 6) Energetics

- Potential (mollified):
  - $\Phi_\eta$ is defined using $\delta_\eta$ shells; at a point:
    $$
    U = q'\,\Phi_\eta
    $$
- Force relation:
  - Holds pointwise for $\Phi_\eta$; as $\eta \to 0$, interpret in the weak sense over resolved intervals:
    $$
    \mathbf{F} = -\nabla U
    $$
- Work‚Äìenergy:
  $$
  \Delta E_k \;=\; \int \mathbf{F}\cdot d\mathbf{s} \;=\; -\,\Delta U
  $$

Plain language: With slightly thick shells, the usual ‚Äúforce is minus gradient of potential‚Äù works; in the razor-thin limit it works after integrating over small time windows.

## 7) Units and symbols

- $v=1$ by default (dimensionless speed unit).
- $\epsilon = |e|/6$ is the unit charge magnitude; Electrino $q=-\epsilon$, Positrino $q=+\epsilon$.
- $\kappa>0$ universal coupling.
- $\eta>0$ mollifier width (regularization parameter).
- $\large q_{\mathrm{eff}}(t_0) = \dfrac{q}{1 + \lvert v_{\text{source}}(t_0)\rvert}$ (per-wavefront amplitude); receiver modulation $\large \dfrac{1}{1 + \lvert v_{\text{receiver}}(t)\rvert}$.
- $r$, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$ as above; $H$ is the Heaviside step function with $H(0)=0$.

Plain language: Fix units so the field speed is one; use Œµ as the basic charge; faster motion dims per-wavefront amplitude and response, not cadence.

---

## 8) Exclusions and scope

- No Lorentzian 4-vectors or Minkowski metric in the core specification.
- No v√óB, no magnetic right-hand rule constructs; ‚Äúmagnetic-like‚Äù phenomena are emergent from retardation geometry.
- Keep alternate presentations (forms/differential geometry) in clearly marked appendices if needed.

---

## 9) Editorial micro-style

- After formal definitions, add a brief ‚ÄúPlain language‚Äù sentence.
- Use consistent symbol set: $\mathcal{C}_j(t)$, $r$, $\hat{\mathbf{r}}$, $v$, $\epsilon$, $\kappa$.
- Equation tags (optional): (RT) retarded-time, (EOM) equation of motion, (REG) regularization, (ENER) energetics.
- Phrase velocity effects as ‚Äúper-wavefront amplitude and receiver response modulation; emission cadence is constant.‚Äù
