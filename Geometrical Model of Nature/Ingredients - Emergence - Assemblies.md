## üß≠ Ontological Framework of Dynamical Geometry

We seek to model nature through a minimal set of fundamental entities and their interactions, expressed geometrically within a continuous manifold. The foundational structure is defined as:

### üß± Timespace Manifold

Let the ambient manifold be defined as:

$$
\mathcal{M} = \mathbb{R}^4 = \mathbb{R}_t \times \mathbb{R}^3_x
$$

where each point in timespace is represented as:

$$
\mathbf{p} = (t, x, y, z) \quad \text{with } t, x, y, z \in \mathbb{R}
$$

#### Properties of $\mathcal{M}$

- $\mathcal{M}$ is a continuous, differentiable, and unbounded manifold.
- It admits no intrinsic metric, origin, or coordinate system; all such structures are emergent.
- It serves as a vessel for the traversal and emission of point objects.
- It is absolute in the sense that all entities are embedded within it, though it lacks intrinsic quantum granularity.

### ‚öõÔ∏è Point Objects

Let $\mathcal{P}$ denote the set of all point objects. Each point object $o \in \mathcal{P}$ is defined by the following properties:

- It emits scalar potential $\phi$ at a constant rate.
- Emission originates at $\mathbf{p}_o(t)$ as a Dirac delta:  
  $$
  \phi(\mathbf{r}, t) = \delta(\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{p}_o(t))
  $$
- The emitted potential propagates spherically at a fixed field speed $c_f$.
- The magnitude of potential at radial distance $r$ satisfies:
  $$
  |\phi(r)| \propto \frac{1}{r^2}
  $$
- Each object possesses kinetic energy $K$ and potential energy $U$.
- Polarity is binary: $q_o \in \{+1, -1\}$, denoting positrino or electrino.
- The object traverses a continuous path $\gamma_o: \mathbb{R} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}$.
- Velocity $v_o = \frac{d\gamma_o}{dt}$ may satisfy $|v_o| <, =, > c_f$.
- The condition $|v_o| = c_f$ defines a symmetry-breaking threshold.
- If $|v_o| > c_f$, the object may intersect its own emitted potential field.
- Each object has unique provenance: it is non-interchangeable, non-destructible, and irreducible.

### üåê Emission Dynamics

Let $\Phi_o(t)$ denote the expanding potential field emitted by object $o$ at time $t$:

- Emission is initiated at $\mathbf{p}_o(t)$ as a Dirac delta.
- The potential field expands spherically with radius $r(t) = c_f \cdot (t - t_0)$.
- The surface of the potential sphere at time $t$ is:
  $$
  S_o(t) = \left\{ \mathbf{r} \in \mathbb{R}^3 : \|\mathbf{r} - \mathbf{p}_o(t_0)\| = c_f \cdot (t - t_0) \right\}
  $$

### üßÆ Action Formalism

Action occurs when a point object $o'$ intersects the potential field $\Phi_o$ of another object $o$:

- The interaction follows superposition:
  $$
  \Phi_{\text{net}} = \sum_{i} \Phi_i
  $$
- The force $\mathbf{F}$ experienced by $o'$ is a function of its velocity and the gradient of the intersected potential:
  $$
  \mathbf{F} \propto -\nabla \phi \quad \text{along the vector } \mathbf{p}_{o'}(t) - \mathbf{p}_o(t')
  $$

---

### üß≠ Path Geometry

Each object $o$ traces a continuous path $\gamma_o(t)$ through $\mathcal{M}$:

- $\gamma_o$ has no known initial condition in $\mathbb{R}^4$.
- The path history $\Gamma_o = \{ \gamma_o(t) \mid t < t_{\text{now}} \}$ encodes velocity vectors and emission events.
- The endpoint $\gamma_o(t_{\text{now}})$ defines the current location.
- The union of emission spheres over time forms a nested structure of expanding shells.

---

### üìè Measurement and Emergence

- No fundamental units of time or distance are defined a priori.
- Units emerge from stable dynamical structures, such as binary orbits.
- The binary system exhibits maximal curvature and frequency, forming a potential well.
- Emergent units allow construction of relative coordinate systems:
  $$
  \text{Let } \tau, \rho \text{ be emergent units of time and distance, respectively.}
  $$

---

### üß© Assembly and Recursion

- The universe is modeled as an unbounded set $\mathcal{P}$ of interacting point objects.
- Assemblies are emergent structures formed by recursive interactions.
- The binary assembly $\mathcal{A}_2 = \{o_+, o_-\}$ (positrino-electrino pair) is the minimal stable unit.
- Assemblies may nest recursively:
  $$
  \mathcal{A}_n = \bigcup_{i=1}^{k} \mathcal{A}_{n_i} \quad \text{with } \sum n_i = n
  $$
- All assemblies are reducible to subassemblies, forming a recursive hierarchy.

Would you like to define the dynamics of curvature, frequency, or recursive assembly in more formal terms next?
