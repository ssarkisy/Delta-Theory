# Orbiting Binary Assembly

Note: This document follows the Mathematical Style Guide (Geometrical Model of Nature/20 - Informational Layer/20.1 - Semantic Interfaces/20.1.1 - Schemas & Conventions/Mathematical Style Guide.md).

An orbiting binary is the simplest emergent assembly, consisting of two Architrinos of opposite chargeâ€”an Electrino and a Positrino. With charges $-\epsilon$ and $+\epsilon$, the assembly is electrically neutral overall. This system demonstrates the fundamental principles of interaction, including the consequences of delayed potential and the role of the velocity symmetry point. 

### 1. System Definition and Equations of Motion

Let's consider the ideal case of a symmetric orbit in a universe with no other Architrinos.

Let the Electrino be particle 1 and the Positrino be particle 2.
-   **Positions:** $\mathbf{s}_1(t)$ and $\mathbf{s}_2(t)$
-   **Charges:** $q_1 = -\epsilon$ and $q_2 = +\epsilon$

The motion of each particle is determined by the field emitted by the other at a delayed time. The acceleration of the Electrino (particle 1) at time $t$ is caused by the Positrino's (particle 2) field emitted at a delayed time $t'$. This is governed by the interaction condition:
$$
\|\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t')\| = v(t - t')
$$
The acceleration vector for the Electrino is attractive, pointing towards the Positrino's delayed position:
$$
\mathbf{a}_1(t) \propto -\hat{\mathbf{r}}_{2'1} = - \frac{\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t')}{\|\mathbf{s}_1(t) - \mathbf{s}_2(t')\|}
$$
A symmetric set of equations governs the Positrino's motion based on the Electrino's emissions.

### 2. The Inward Exponential Spiral

In this system, a stable, circular orbit is impossible. Because the attractive force on each particle points to the *past* position of its partner, it is not a true central force. This delay results in a trajectory that is an **inward exponential spiral**.

-   The tangential component of the delayed force sustains the orbital motion.
-   The radial component continuously pulls the particles closer together.

With perfectly symmetric initial conditions (e.g., starting at rest), the paths of the Electrino and Positrino are distinct but perfect mirror images of each other. As they spiral inward, their speeds continuously increase. Consequently, according to the velocity-modulated emission rule, the effective charge $q_{eff}$ (per-wavefront amplitude) continuously decreases as speed rises. This does not alter the emission cadence: Architrinos emit at a constant rate; only the per-wavefront amplitude is modulated.

### 3. Evolution Through Velocity Regimes

The binary system's evolution is characterized by two distinct phases defined by the velocity symmetry point.

#### **Contraction Phase ($|\mathbf{v}| \le v$)**
Initially, and as long as the speeds of both particles are less than or equal to the field speed $v$, they are only influenced by their partner's attractive field. The total acceleration is simply the attractive force:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{1, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{1,2}(t) \quad \text{and} \quad \mathbf{a}_{2, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{2,1}(t)
$$
During this phase, the system is purely contractile, with the particles accelerating and spiraling towards each other.

#### **Deflationary Phase ($|\mathbf{v}| > v$)**
Once the particles' speeds exceed the field speed $v$, they cross the symmetry point and begin to interact with their own recently emitted, repulsive sphere streams. The total acceleration on each particle now becomes a superposition of attraction from its partner and self-repulsion. For the Electrino:
$$
\mathbf{a}_{1, \text{total}}(t) = \mathbf{a}_{1,2}(t) + \mathbf{a}_{1,1}(t)
$$
The new self-repulsive term, $\mathbf{a}_{1,1}(t)$, acts to increase the particle's velocity, causing the inward spiral to tighten and wind down even faster. This phase is "deflationary" as the self-interaction accelerates the collapse of the binary system.

### 4. The Stable State and Emergent Properties

The deflationary spiral does not continue indefinitely. The self-repulsive force creates a dynamic feedback mechanism that ultimately stabilizes the system and prevents a singularity.

#### **Curvature Limit and Stability**
The inward spiral does not lead to a singularity. The limiting factor is the geometry of self-interaction. As the spiral tightens, the path's curvature increases, bringing each Architrino closer to its own recent emission points. This proximity dramatically amplifies the self-repulsive force. The system reaches a critical state where any further decrease in orbital radius would cause an overwhelming increase in this self-repulsion, effectively creating a "pressure" that resists further collapse. The inward spiral is halted not by a simple balance of forces, but by this geometric feedback loop.

At this limit, the trajectory stabilizes, and the system settles into a **stable, circular orbit of a minimum radius**. This final state is a dynamic equilibrium where the inward pull from the partner is perfectly channeled into the circular motion, while the self-repulsive force prevents any further tightening of the path's curvature.

#### **Emergent Properties**
The stabilization of the orbiting binary gives rise to fundamental, emergent properties for the universe:
-   **An Emergent Unit of Distance:** The radius of this stable orbit is a constant, determined by the fundamental parameters of the model (field speed $v$, charge $\epsilon$). It serves as the smallest possible orbital radius and thus becomes a natural, emergent unit of distance.
-   **An Imposed Speed Limit:** While individual Architrinos have no inherent speed limit, the particles within this stable assembly are constrained to a specific, constant orbital speed. This creates a practical speed limit for particles bound within such structures.
-   **A Zero-Potential Axis:** In an ideal, symmetric orbit, the positive and negative potentials emitted by the two particles perfectly cancel along the axis of rotation. This creates a line of zero net potential. In a sense, this axis acts as a "wormhole" through which another Architrino could pass without being accelerated by the binary, provided its path is perfectly aligned with the axis.

**Note on Complex Scenarios:** The analysis above describes a stationary binary system. More complex dynamics arise when the binary assembly is also translating through space, especially when the axis of orbit is not aligned with the direction of the group's velocity.
