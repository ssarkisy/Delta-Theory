# Photons and Neutrinos: Neutral, Geometric Channels

Note: This document follows the Mathematical Style Guide (Geometrical Model of Nature/20 - Informational Layer/20.1 - Semantic Interfaces/20.1.1 - Schemas & Conventions/Mathematical Style Guide.md). We work in units with field speed v = 1 unless stated otherwise.

## 1) Photons: Propagating Neutral Vortex Bundles

Definition (geometric): A photon is a coherent, charge-neutral, propagating bundle of delayed, purely radial per-hit actions organized along an axis. It is not a fundamental particle but an emergent, self-guided packet formed by phase-locked coupling of axial structures produced by oscillatory sources (e.g., binaries within assemblies). In this view, “emission” and “absorption” are re-coupling events of this bundle to and from internal binaries, transferring energy and angular momentum without inventorying a separate gauge field.

- Neutrality:
  - Net charge is zero at all times; the packet’s far field is dominated by transverse, oscillatory components from retardation geometry.
- Axial geometry:
  - The packet is supported on a narrow, quasi-cylindrical corridor aligned with a propagation axis ê. Within this corridor, the superposed 1/r² shells from the driving source(s) maintain a phase structure that self-guides the bundle.
- Polarization and helicity:
  - Linear polarization = fixed orientation of the principal transverse oscillation ellipse relative to ê.
  - Circular/elliptic polarization = constant-phase rotation of that ellipse around ê; helicity is the sign of this axial phase winding.
- Kinematics:
  - Group velocity ~ v (≈ 1 in our units); there is no rest frame (apparent rest energy is zero).
  - Energy–frequency correspondence: for a coherent, periodic source of angular frequency ω, the apparent energy transported by the bundle scales as E_app ∝ ω over resolved intervals, set by the source’s discrete normal modes.
- Interaction rules (emergent):
  - Coupling is strongest to assemblies with compatible axial corridors (polar regions of binaries/cores).
  - Absorption = re-capture of the bundle’s phase-locked structure by an internal binary, increasing its mode energy or reconfiguring personality architrinos.
  - Emission = release of a phase-locked corridor driven by an accelerating neutral or charged subassembly.

Plain language: A photon is a tight, neutral beam made of many delayed radial pushes that line up down a tube; its “polarization” is just the way that tube wiggles sideways as it moves, and it gets made or eaten when that tube locks onto (or peels off) internal rotating pairs.

## 2) Neutrinos: Highly Shielded Noether-Core Excitations

Definition (geometric): A neutrino is a Noether Core in a strongly shielded, net-neutral configuration, carrying a small residual, time-averaged external field. Its interactions are weak because superposition inside the core cancels nearly all external projection; only subtle axial mismatches and phase drifts couple to outside structures.

- Structure:
  - Triply nested binaries with no net personality charge (q_net = 0). Rapid internal motion produces near-complete far-field cancellation (shielding).
- Propagation:
  - Travels essentially along straight lines at speeds close to v, with small deflections only from coherent axial couplings.
- Flavor and oscillation:
  - “Flavor” corresponds to which internal binary (of the three) predominantly hosts the residual phase imbalance. Slow exchange of this imbalance among the three binaries yields flavor oscillations over distance, without invoking a fundamental mass term; the beat pattern follows from internal phase dynamics and retardation geometry.
- Chirality (handedness constraint):
  - The residual coupling to external axial corridors is chiral: geometric selection rules favor one axial phase winding over the other in emission/capture from typical sources, producing the observed handedness bias in interactions.
- Interactions:
  - Dominated by axial corridor overlap with other shielded/neutral assemblies and by transient, localized re-couplings near polar regions of cores. Cross sections are tiny because the exterior field is a faint residue.

Plain language: A neutrino is a very quiet, neutral core whose outside “whisper” changes which inner loop is slightly ahead; that whisper swaps loops slowly as it flies, so its type oscillates, and it only bumps into things that line up just right along an axis.
