# Nested binaries
- discuss nesting up to three binaries.
- why 3? because space is 3 dimensional.
- a triply nested binary is called a Noether core, after Emmy Noether. and why as a note.
- in a Noether core the binaries are stabilized from within by the emissions of the internal binaries.
- the three binaries have vastly different radii.

add to orbiting binary that in the ideal case, the orbital axis has zero potential. In a sense it is a wormhole through which another Architrino could pass without being impacted by the binary.

Then go on to fermions.

Group velocity and change from Fermi-Dirac to Bose-Einstein statistics.
