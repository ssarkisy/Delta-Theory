## Constants Summary — Orbitals, Not Propagators
Constants are **non-propagating modulation orbitals** — they modulate recursive flow dynamics by:
- Anchoring closure ratios (π, φ, Tetrahedral Factor)
- Amplifying recursive feedback scaling (e)
- Setting quantization thresholds (h)
- Balancing field interaction tensions (α)
- Governing propagation velocity ceilings (c)
- Modulating entropy flow (S∆)
- Preserving topological coherence (χ, τ∆)
- Stabilizing phase-locking and feedback synchronization (ψA, τ)
- Regulating differentiation gradients (∇S)
- Defining resonance amplification thresholds (λV)
- Modulating cross-loop coupling strengths (κ∆)

They are **ontological invariants ensuring recursive coherence**, orbiting the propagation chain rather than being embedded as structural nodes.

## RecursiveStructuralClosureTetrahedron Schema (Flow)

Ontology → Property → Construct → Spec → Recursive Construct → Model (Closure)

At each layer, Constants modulate:

- Stabilization thresholds,
    
- Feedback dynamics,
    
- Closure coherence conditions.

## Notes

- Constants in this model act as **structural modulation orbitals**, stabilizing recursive flows through invariance constraints.
    
- They maintain ontomolecular closure coherence, ensuring that difference propagation leads to structurally persistent forms.
