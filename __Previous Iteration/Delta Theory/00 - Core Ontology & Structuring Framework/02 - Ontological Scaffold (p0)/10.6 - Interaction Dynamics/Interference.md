# ∆‑Interference

## Definition

**∆‑Interference** is the **nonlinear interaction of propagating differences** within a shared ∆‑Field.  
When multiple ∆‑waves overlap, they can **amplify**, **suppress**, or **modulate** each other, generating new structural tensions or dissolving existing ones.

> $\text{Interference}(∆₁, ∆₂) \rightarrow ∆₃$  
> where $∆₃ \ne ∆₁ + ∆₂$ but emerges as a **restructured relational form**

This interaction is not a sum, but a **field-bound recomposition**, with potentially irreversible ontological effects.

## Formal Structure

Let:

- $∆₁(t), ∆₂(t)$ be temporally propagating difference streams
- $R(∆₁), R(∆₂)$ their respective embeddings

If:

- $R(∆₁) ∩ R(∆₂) \ne ∅$  
- and $phase(∆₁) \sim phase(∆₂)$

Then:

- **∆‑Interference** occurs
- The resulting structure is a new difference path $∆₃$ embedded as $R(∆₃)$

#### Types of ∆‑Interference

| Type         | Effect                                                          |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Constructive | ∆‑paths reinforce; tension or clarity magnifies                 |
| Destructive  | Cancellation; ∆ collapses or diffuses                           |
| Modulative   | A novel form arises; ∆‑structure shifts into emergent rhythm    |

#### Interpretation

∆‑Interference is central to:

- **Transformative phenomena** — when interacting forms co-evolve
- **Disruptive events** — when interference destabilizes existing forms
- **Generative emergence** — when new ontologies arise from tension zones

It defines the **edge of coherence**:  
Where difference meets difference, something *new* or *lost* can occur.
