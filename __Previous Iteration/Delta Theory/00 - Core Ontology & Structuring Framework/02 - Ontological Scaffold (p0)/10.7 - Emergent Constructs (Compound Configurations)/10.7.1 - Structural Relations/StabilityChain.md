# StabilityChain(Rⁿ)

## Explanation / Definition

**StabilityChain(Rⁿ)** defines the **recursive resilience condition** of a relational structure $Rⁿ(∆₀)$, where each embedding level supports and sustains the emergence of a coherent form $Fₙ$.

In ∆‑theory, this condition determines whether a difference can **persist**, **self‑stabilize**, and **resist collapse** across recursive generations.

> A stable $Rⁿ(∆₀)$ continues to **generate**, **resonate**, and **self‑reinforce** a coherent identity.

---

## Formal Interpretation

Let $Rⁿ(∆₀)$ be the $n$‑level recursive embedding of a primitive difference.

Then:

> $StabilityChain(Rⁿ) ∝ PersistenceOfRPath × ClosureStrength × FeedbackResonance$

This is a **structural composite**, not a strict equation — a triadic diagnostic lens:

- **PersistenceOfRPath** — the reliability of difference transmission through recursive embeddings  
- **ClosureStrength** — the loop-tightness of recursive forms; degree of internal referencing  
- **FeedbackResonance** — internally sustained ∆‑resonance across layers

When these components reinforce one another, the structure achieves **high recursive stability**.

## Core Properties

| Feature              | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                                     |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recursive Continuity | Each $R$‑layer propagates without degeneration              |
| Self-Reinforcement   | Closure and resonance loops strengthen recursive identity   |
| Collapse Resistance  | Stability buffers against ∆‑dissolution and decoherence     |
| Mass Basis           | Recursive stabilization gives rise to inertial behavior     |

## Usage

- **Mass modeling**: Greater $StabilityChain(Rⁿ)$ corresponds to increased inertia  
- **Collapse diagnostics**: Evaluates when forms are at risk of recursive failure  
- **Phase transitions**: Critical for modeling ∆‑field transformations  
- **Restoration support**: Chains with high stability enable recovery via [[Restore]]
