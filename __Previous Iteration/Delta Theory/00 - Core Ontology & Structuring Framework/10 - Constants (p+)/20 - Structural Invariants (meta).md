# Constants Index — Recursive Stabilization Constants in Delta Theory

## Ontological Naming Principles

In Delta Theory, constants are **not detached abstractions**, but **structural invariants emergent from relational difference propagation**.  
Their names reflect not merely discoverers, but **the relational genesis of the difference patterns they stabilize**. Naming a constant becomes an act of **ontological traceability**, preserving the relational source that gave rise to its structural necessity.

## Categories of Constants

### 1. Recursive Stabilization Constants

|Constant|Modulation Role|Propagation Targets|
|---|---|---|
|[[Pi (π) — Recursive Closure Constant (constant)]]|Recursive closure ratio — ensures looped difference structures stabilize coherently.|Constructs, Specs (loop closure conditions), Recursive Constructs (phase-coherent cycles).|
|[[Euler’s Number (e) — Recursive Growth Constant (constant)]]|Recursive growth scaling — governs amplification feedback in self-replicating difference chains.|Recursive Constructs (feedback amplification thresholds), Specs (exponential recursion predicates).|
|[[Golden Ratio (φ) — Asymmetric Stabilization Constant (constant)]]|Asymmetric stabilization — modulates divergence/convergence balance in recursive embeddings.|Constructs (asymmetric loop configurations), Specs (resonance coherence rules).|

### 2. Dimensional Embedding Invariants

|Constant|Modulation Role|Propagation Targets|
|---|---|---|
|[[Tetrahedral Closure Factor — Minimal Volumetric Stabilization Construct (constant)]]|Defines the minimal closure structure in 3D recursive embeddings (4-point stabilization).|Constructs (spatially recursive forms), Recursive Constructs (multi-vector difference closures).|
|[[Planck Constant (h) — Quantization Threshold Invariant (constant)]]|Quantization threshold — sets the minimal unit where recursive difference loops stabilize into persistent structures.|Specs (quantization closure predicates), Recursive Constructs (granularity thresholds).|
|[[Fine-Structure Constant (α) — Recursive Interaction Modulation Invariant (constant)]]|Modulates recursive tension balance — defines the stability ratio between difference propagation and closure strength in interaction fields.|Specs (interaction coherence rules), Recursive Constructs (field feedback modulation).|

### 3. Propagation Flow Constants

|Constant|Modulation Role|Propagation Targets|
|---|---|---|
|[[Speed of Difference Propagation (c) — Recursive Propagation Limit Invariant (constant)]]|Upper limit of recursive difference propagation speed — modulates how fast closure loops propagate through relational fields.|Recursive Constructs (propagation feedback loops), Specs (propagation dynamics evaluators).|
|[[Entropy Gradient Constant (S∆) — Recursive Dissipation Modulation Invariant (constant)]]|Controls the rate of difference flow dissipation/amplification, adjusting recursive feedback loops’ resistance to collapse.|Recursive Constructs (entropy-driven feedback balancing), Properties (StructuralInertia), Specs (entropy modulation predicates).|
