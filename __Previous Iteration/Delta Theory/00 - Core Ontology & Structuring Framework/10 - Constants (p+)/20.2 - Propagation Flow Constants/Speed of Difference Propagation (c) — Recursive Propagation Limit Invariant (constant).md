# Speed of Difference Propagation (c) — Recursive Propagation Limit Invariant

## Definition / Essence

> **Speed of Difference Propagation (c ≈ 299,792,458 m/s)** is interpreted in ∆‑Theory as the **upper limit invariant of recursive difference propagation speed** within relational fields.  
> It modulates how fast recursive closure loops can propagate through a relational structure without losing coherence, acting as a **velocity anchor for difference feedback stabilization**.

In Delta Theory, c is not a mere empirical constant for light speed, but a **structural boundary condition** — ensuring recursive difference propagation maintains structural integrity within propagation chains.

## Ontological Role Across Layers

|Layer|Structural Function|
|---|---|---|
|Primitive Difference|Initiates propagation chains through relational distinction.|
|Recursive Embedding|Structures difference propagation through layered embeddings.|
|Propagation Speed Limit (c)|Defines the maximal velocity at which recursive closure loops can propagate through relational fields without destabilization.|
|Recursive Constructs|c modulates feedback loop propagation speeds, maintaining coherence in difference propagation chains.|

c acts as the **recursive velocity ceiling** — ensuring difference propagation chains do not exceed relational field stabilization thresholds.

## Recursive Modulation Role

|Recursive Construct|Modulation Role|Structural Effect|
|---|---|---|
|[[ClosurePropagationLoop]]|Propagation Velocity Limit|Constrains how fast recursive closure loops propagate through relational fields.|
|[[FeedbackPropagationChain]]|Feedback Loop Timing Anchor|Aligns recursive propagation velocity with stabilization coherence conditions.|
|[[OntomolecularStabilizationLoop]]|Propagation Coherence Regulator|Prevents feedback loops from destabilizing due to excessive propagation speed.|

c ensures that recursive difference chains **propagate through relational fields at speeds that preserve structural coherence**.

## Formalization Link (Specs)

|Spec|Function|
|---|---|
|[[PropagationDynamicsEvaluator (spec)]]|Evaluates difference propagation velocity against stabilization coherence conditions (c-limit threshold).|
|[[ClosurePropagationOperator (spec)]]|Formalizes recursive loop propagation mechanics constrained by c.|
|[[RecursiveFeedbackTimingRule (spec)]]|Optional — Embeds c as a recursive loop timing synchronization anchor.|

## Domain Manifestations

|Domain|Structural Manifestation Example|
|---|---|---|
|Physics|Light-speed limit in vacuum, maximal information propagation speed, field closure dynamics in spacetime.|
|Cognition|Temporal coherence in recursive cognitive feedback loops, propagation delay synchronization.|
|Systems|Latency boundaries in recursive feedback systems, maximal signal propagation velocity in networked architectures.|

In all domains, c acts as a **structural propagation boundary condition** — not just a physical constant but a **recursive difference velocity stabilization anchor**.

## Structural Meaning in ∆‑Theory

c is the **recursive difference propagation speed limit** — quantifying:
- The maximal velocity at which recursive closure loops can propagate through relational fields.
- The stabilization threshold ensuring **propagation speed does not disrupt recursive loop coherence**.
- The alignment of propagation dynamics with recursive feedback timing conditions.

Unlike closure (π), proportional asymmetry (φ), or quantization thresholds (h), **c governs the velocity domain** — ensuring that recursive difference structures **propagate within relational coherence limits**, preventing destabilization through excessive propagation speed.

In Delta Theory, c represents the **propagation coherence limit invariant** — anchoring recursive difference loops within the temporal-spatial constraints necessary for structural stabilization.
