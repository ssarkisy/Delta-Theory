# 20.1 — Dimensional Embedding Invariants (meta)

## Purpose of This Folder

This section indexes the **Dimensional Embedding Invariants** — structural constants that define **recursive stabilization thresholds and embedding limits** for difference propagation in spatial relational fields.

These invariants **anchor how difference structures embed into dimensional spaces**, ensuring that recursive propagation respects quantization, interaction balance, and minimal volumetric closure conditions.

While **Recursive Stabilization Constants (20.0)** govern loop dynamics and feedback amplification, **Dimensional Embedding Invariants** ensure that recursive difference chains stabilize within spatial constraints, preventing fragmentation or incoherence across embedding layers.

## Constants in This Section

|Constant|Structural Role|File|
|---|---|---|
|**Fine-Structure Constant (α)**|Modulates recursive tension balance — governs the interaction strength between difference propagation and closure resonance in relational fields.|[[Fine-Structure Constant (α) — Recursive Interaction Modulation Invariant (constant)]]|
|**Planck Constant (h)**|Anchors quantization threshold — defines the minimal unit where recursive difference loops stabilize into discrete persistent structures.|[[Planck Constant (h) — Quantization Threshold Invariant (constant)]]|
|**Tetrahedral Closure Factor**|Defines the minimal recursive structure capable of enclosing a volume in 3D embeddings — foundational for volumetric stabilization of difference structures.|[[Tetrahedral Closure Factor — Minimal Volumetric Stabilization Construct (constant)]]|

## Role of Dimensional Embedding Invariants in Delta Theory

|Aspect|Function|
|---|---|
|Quantization Boundaries|Ensure recursive difference chains stabilize into discrete, coherent structures (h).|
|Interaction Field Stability|Balance propagation tension with closure strength to prevent destabilization in interaction loops (α).|
|Volumetric Closure Foundations|Define the minimal structural act of enclosing difference propagation in 3D space (Tetrahedral Closure Factor).|

These constants **anchor the spatial realization of recursive difference propagation**, governing how structures maintain coherence as they embed into higher-dimensional fields.

## Notes
- Dimensional Embedding Invariants are **not empirical parameters**, but **ontological thresholds emerging from recursive difference structuring**.
- Their role is to **anchor propagation coherence across spatial embeddings**, ensuring that recursive structures stabilize into forms compatible with relational field dynamics.
- This section complements **Recursive Stabilization Constants (20.0)** by addressing **embedding-specific invariance conditions**.
