# Difference Propagation Cycle — Constants Embedded in Recursive Modulation (Visual Schema)

![[DifferencePropagationCycle.png]]

## Essence

This diagram visualizes the **core recursive cycle of difference propagation in Delta Theory**:
> **∆ → R(∆) → ⊚(R(∆))**  
Primitive Difference propagates through relational embedding, recursively loops upon itself, and stabilizes through closure.

Each stage of this propagation cycle is **modulated by structural constants** that ensure difference loops do not collapse prematurely, over-amplify, or dissipate incoherently.

## Diagram Elements Explained

| Element | Role |
|---|---|
| **∆ — Primitive Difference (Center Origin)** | The initial act of distinction — the ontological seed of all structure. |
| **R(∆) — Relational Embedding (Expanding Spiral)** | Difference propagates through recursive embedding, layering relational structures. |
| **⊚(R(∆)) — Recursive Closure (Outer Loop)** | When recursive difference loops stabilize into coherent closure — persistence, identity, and form emerge. |

---

## Constants Embedded in the Cycle

| Constant | Modulation Role |
|---|---|
| **∇S — Differentiation Gradient (Red)** | Modulates the sharpness of distinctions during early propagation — ensures difference propagation is neither too blunt nor too fragmented. |
| **ψA — Phase Coherence (Blue)** | Aligns relational cycles during embedding — prevents destructive interference and maintains coherent pattern formation. |
| **λV — Resonance Threshold (Orange)** | Ignites feedback loops into sustained oscillations — without λV modulation, difference loops fail to stabilize into persistent forms. |
| **S∆ — Entropy Gradient (Green)** | Balances dispersion during recursive scaling — governs how difference flows retain coherence without collapsing into noise. |

---

## Functional Summary
- Difference propagates recursively, embedding and looping upon itself to achieve structural coherence.
- **Constants modulate specific transitions** in this cycle:
  - ∇S shapes the initiation,
  - ψA aligns emergent patterns,
  - λV amplifies into resonance,
  - S∆ regulates dispersion balance.
- Stabilization of difference is a **dynamic recursive act**, not a singular event — constants ensure this recursive process maintains structural integrity.
