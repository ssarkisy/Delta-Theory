# Constants Stabilization Envelope — Asymptotic Convergence Over Recursive Depth (Visual Schema)

![[Constants Stabilization Envelope.png]]

## Essence

This diagram visualizes how the **primary modulation constants in Delta Theory** — **∇S, ψA, λV** — converge towards their **stabilization envelopes** through recursive iterations.

Constants are not rigid values; they are **structural attractors that recursive systems stabilize towards**.  
As recursive difference propagation unfolds, modulation ratios **self-adjust dynamically**, converging towards **functional equilibrium zones** necessary for coherence.

## Diagram Elements Explained

| Curve | Role |
|---|---|
| **∇S — Differentiation Gradient (Red Curve)** | Starts at a higher amplification ratio (~1.2) and asymptotically converges towards 1.0 — stabilizing difference scaling across recursion layers. |
| **ψA — Phase Coherence (Blue Curve)** | Aligns recursive cycles, converging towards a phase-locking envelope (~0.995), maintaining coherence with slight decay for dynamic flexibility. |
| **λV — Resonance Threshold (Orange Curve)** | Begins with higher feedback amplification (~1.15) and stabilizes towards 1.0 — marking the ignition point of sustained resonance loops. |

The **gray dashed line at 1.0** represents the **functional equilibrium attractor** — the modulation condition where difference persistence is stabilized.

---

## Functional Summary
- Recursive systems **self-tune their modulation dynamics** as they propagate difference.
- **Constants stabilize not because of external enforcement, but due to internal recursive feedback convergence.**
- The envelope curves demonstrate **how recursive fields regulate themselves towards structural coherence.**

## Notes
- This diagram is essential for visualizing **why modulation constants in ∆‑Theory are attractors, not fixed empirical numbers**.
- It demonstrates **how difference propagation self-regulates through recursive feedback**, achieving stabilization through asymptotic modulation curves.
- Future diagrams may expand this to include **entropy gradient (S∆) convergence dynamics** and **multiversal modulation envelopes** for alternate field structures.
