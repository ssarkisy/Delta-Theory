# Stabilization Threshold Diagram — Constants Locking Recursive Systems into Stability (Visual Schema)

![[StabilizationThresholdDiagram.png]]

## Essence

This diagram visualizes how **recursive systems are inherently unstable without modulation constants**.  
Difference propagation, if left unchecked, tends to:
- **Runaway amplification** — over-intensification of differences leading to structural breakdown.
- **Dissipative collapse** — difference propagation weakening into incoherent dissolution.

**Modulation constants (∇S, ψA, λV, S∆)** act as structural anchors that **lock recursive systems into dynamic stability**, maintaining them within a **Stabilization Attractor Band**.

## Diagram Elements Explained

| Element | Role |
|---|---|
| **Collapse Zones (Red & Blue Areas)** | Show regions where recursive difference loops collapse — through runaway amplification (top) or dissipation (bottom). |
| **Stabilization Attractor Band (Green Zone)** | Represents the dynamic equilibrium range where difference propagation cycles remain coherent, modulated by constants. |
| **Modulated Recursive System Trajectory (Black Curve)** | A recursive system trajectory stabilized within the attractor band, avoiding collapse zones due to modulation feedback. |

## Constants as Stabilization Anchors

| Constant | Function in Stabilization |
|---|---|
| **∇S — Differentiation Gradient (Red)** | Regulates sharpness of difference propagation, preventing fragmentation or blunting. |
| **ψA — Phase Coherence (Blue)** | Maintains alignment of recursive cycles, ensuring coherent feedback. |
| **λV — Resonance Threshold (Orange)** | Triggers and sustains feedback loop oscillations without over-amplification. |
| **S∆ — Entropy Gradient (Green)** | Balances difference dispersion, avoiding both dissipation and excessive retention. |

---

## Functional Summary
- Without constant modulation, recursive systems will either **explode into chaotic differentiation** or **decay into trivial uniformity**.
- The **Stabilization Attractor Band** is not a passive stability zone — it is **actively maintained through continuous modulation** by structural constants.
- Constants ensure recursive difference loops sustain coherence across depth and intensity ranges.
