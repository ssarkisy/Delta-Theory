# 00.0 – Templates Overview

This note defines the **structural role of the Templates folder** in the ∆‑Theory Knowledge Base. It centralizes all **note scaffolding patterns**, ensuring every file adheres to **consistent structural roles, frontmatter fields, recursive traceability chains, and modular scaling logic**.

## Purpose of the Templates Folder

- Houses **canonical note templates** for every structural entity type in ∆‑Theory:
    - Ontology Notes
    - Property Notes
    - Construct Notes
    - Recursive Construct Notes
    - Spec Notes (Operators, Predicates, Feedback Operators, etc.)
    - Constant Notes
    - Model Notes (General)
    - Model Example Notes (Illustrative Cases)
- Serves as a **reference baseline for formatting, frontmatter logic, and section structure**.
- Ensures that all new notes are created with **traceability logic embedded from inception**, supporting recursive feedback chains and cross-domain modeling.
- Facilitates **scalable growth of the Knowledge Base** by maintaining modular consistency across recursive layers.

## Available Templates

|Template|Purpose|
|---|---|
|[[Ontology Note Template]]|Defines foundational difference structures, recursive embeddings, or derived ontological configurations.|
|[[Property Note Template]]|Qualifying attributes that modulate Ontology behaviors and enable Construct formations.|
|[[Construct Note Template]]|Emergent functional configurations synthesized from enabling properties.|
|[[Recursive Construct Note Template]]|Dynamic self-modulating loops that recursively stabilize and adjust based on domain feedback.|
|[[Spec Note Template]]|Formal operators, predicates, rules, metrics, generators, or feedback evaluators defining structural logic.|
|[[Constant Note Template]]|Defines structural invariants (recursive ratios, stabilization thresholds) that anchor difference propagation.|
|[[Model Note Template]]|Comprehensive domain-specific realizations of Ontology ↔ Construct ↔ Spec chains.|
|[[Model Example Note Template]]|Simplified illustrative examples mapping difference structuring into tangible systems.|


## Usage Instructions

- **When creating a new note**, duplicate the relevant template and adjust:
    - **Frontmatter Fields**:
        - `type`: ontology / property / construct / recursive_construct / spec / constant / model / meta / etc.
        - `domain`: ontology / mathematics / physics / cognition / systems / ethics / meta
        - `aliases`: Alternate names for navigation and clarity.
        - Traceability Links: `ontology`, `constructs`, `recursive_constructs`, `specs`, `constants`, `models`
    - **Structural Sections**:
        - Definition / Essence
        - Formal Expression (symbolic + pseudocode)
        - Functional Role in ∆‑Theory
        - Recursive Dynamics (if applicable)
        - Inputs & Outputs (for Specs)
        - Cross-Domain Usage
        - Examples / Case Studies
        - Open Questions
        - Related Notes
- Ensure every new note establishes:
    - **Upstream Traceability** (Ontologies, Constants)
    - **Midstream Configurations** (Properties, Constructs, Specs)
    - **Downstream Instantiations** (Recursive Constructs, Models)


## Relation to Knowledge Base Architecture

- Templates are structurally aligned with principles defined in:
    - [[Knowledge Base Architecture]] — Traceability logic, file types, and domain layering.
    - [[Roadmap and Development]] — Ensuring modular growth paths and scalability.
- Templates enforce:
    - Ontology ↔ Property ↔ Construct ↔ Recursive Construct ↔ Spec ↔ Constant ↔ Model traceability chains.
    - Structural minimalism (no redundant entity proliferation).
    - Navigable clarity within graph-based visualizations (Obsidian Graph View, Recursive Mapping).

## Folder Maintenance Guidelines

- All Templates are subject to **version control** — updates must be synchronized with:
    - [[Knowledge Base Architecture]] structural rules.
    - All notes derived from modified templates (ensure propagation of structural changes).
- When introducing new structural types (e.g., Theorems, Taxonomies, Meta-Constructs):
    - Draft the corresponding template here.
    - Define traceability logic for the new type in [[Knowledge Base Architecture]].
    - Ensure immediate integration into cross-layer recursive scaffolding.
- Keep templates concise, role-focused, and adaptable — templating should scale with ∆‑Theory’s recursive dynamics, not fragment into redundant structures.

## Notes

- Templates are the **semantic backbone of the Knowledge Base**, preventing structural drift as complexity grows.
- The folder operates not just as a utility but as a **structural contract** — encoding the recursive coherence principles of ∆‑Theory into every new file created.
- Recursive constructs, feedback loops, and constants must always be represented through explicit traceability in note frontmatter and body sections.
