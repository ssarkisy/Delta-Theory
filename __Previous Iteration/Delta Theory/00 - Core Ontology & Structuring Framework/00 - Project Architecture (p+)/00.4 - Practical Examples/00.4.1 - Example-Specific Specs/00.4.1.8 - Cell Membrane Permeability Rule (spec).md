# CellMembranePermeabilityRule (spec)

## Definition

**`CellMembranePermeabilityRule`** is a formal **boundary modulation rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (molecules, ions, environmental gradients)** are **selectively propagated, filtered, or modulated across a membrane interface** to maintain system coherence (homeostasis).

It governs:
- **Detection of difference at the membrane boundary (concentration gradients, signal molecules)**.
- **Conditional gating and transport based on structural properties of ∆ (size, charge, affinity)**.
- **Recursive feedback modulation (e.g., upregulation of transporters in response to system state)**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_external`|Primitive Difference|Molecules/ions outside the membrane (external environment)|
|`∆_internal`|Primitive Difference|Molecules/ions inside the membrane (internal system state)|
|`TransportChannel`|Relational Embedding|Membrane protein structures facilitating selective passage|
|`TransportPolicy`|Spec|Rule set defining selectivity criteria (size, polarity, gating conditions)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|FlowEvent|Difference Propagation|Successful or blocked passage of ∆ across the membrane|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether membrane interaction maintains systemic coherence|

## Permeability Condition

Transport Gate Activation:
$$
FlowEvent = Allow(∆) \quad \text{iff} \quad TransportPolicy(∆) = True \quad \land \quad TransportChannel_{open}
$$

Boundary Stabilization:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Flow of ∆_{external/internal} \quad maintains system parameters within functional ranges
$$

Recursive Feedback:
$$
If \quad ∆_{internal} \quad deviates \quad \Rightarrow \quad Modulate(TransportChannel_{expression}, gating behavior)
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆ at membrane boundary:
    if ∆ satisfies TransportPolicy criteria and channel is open:
        propagate ∆ across membrane (FlowEvent)
    else:
        block propagation (no FlowEvent)
    recursively evaluate system state for feedback modulation
````

## Preconditions

- Transport channels and gating mechanisms are structurally intact.
    
- Difference exists between internal and external environments (∆ gradients).
    
- TransportPolicy defines selectivity logic (e.g., size thresholds, charge compatibility).
    

## Postconditions

- Successful propagation modulates internal system state.
    
- Feedback loops (e.g., receptor activation, transporter expression) dynamically adjust membrane permeability.
    
- System coherence (homeostasis) is preserved through regulated difference modulation.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Demonstrates **BoundaryModulation Constructs** where difference is dynamically filtered, not just propagated.
    
- Bridges from simple flow propagation (Hair Dryer) to **recursive boundary regulation dynamics**.
    
- Prepares the conceptual path for modeling **cognitive filters, information gatekeeping systems, and AI attention gating**.

|Neural Signaling|Synaptic transmission modulating ion flow through gated channels|
