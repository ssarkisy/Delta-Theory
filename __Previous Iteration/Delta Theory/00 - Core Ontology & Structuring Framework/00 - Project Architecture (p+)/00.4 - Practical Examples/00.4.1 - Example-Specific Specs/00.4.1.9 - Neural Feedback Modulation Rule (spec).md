# NeuralFeedbackModulationRule (spec)

## Definition

**`NeuralFeedbackModulationRule`** is a formal **feedback modulation rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (neural activations, signal spikes)** are **propagated, modulated, and stabilized within a recursive feedback loop**, ensuring dynamic balance between excitation and inhibition across neural circuits.

It governs:
- **Signal propagation through interconnected neurons (forward and feedback paths)**.
- **Threshold-based activation control (neuron firing conditions)**.
- **Recursive feedback modulation (amplification, inhibition, oscillation damping)** to maintain coherent circuit behavior.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_activation`|Primitive Difference|Incoming activation signal (spike) from pre-synaptic neuron|
|`NeuronState`|Relational Embedding|Current membrane potential and activation threshold of post-synaptic neuron|
|`FeedbackPath`|RecursiveEmbedding|Recursive connection pathways looping back into the circuit|
|`ModulationPolicy`|Spec|Rule set defining feedback strength (gain), damping factors, and inhibition control|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|OutputSpike|Signal|Neural activation output after modulation (firing or inhibited)|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether the feedback loop maintains functional coherence (no runaway excitation or collapse)|

## Modulation Condition

Neuron Firing Logic:
$$
OutputSpike =
\begin{cases}
\text{Emit Spike} & \text{if } NeuronState_{potential} \geq Threshold \\
\text{No Spike} & \text{if } NeuronState_{potential} < Threshold
\end{cases}
$$

Feedback Modulation:
$$
NeuronState_{next} = NeuronState_{current} + (∆_{activation} \cdot FeedbackGain) - InhibitionFactor
$$

Stabilization Condition:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad NeuronState_{oscillation} \quad \text{remains within functional amplitude bounds}
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆_activation input:
    NeuronState.potential += ∆_activation * FeedbackGain - InhibitionFactor
    if NeuronState.potential >= Threshold:
        emit OutputSpike
        propagate ∆_activation to FeedbackPath
    recursively evaluate FeedbackPath to adjust future NeuronState
    check if oscillations remain stable (Stabilization)
````

## Preconditions

- Neural connections (synaptic pathways) are correctly embedded.
    
- Each neuron maintains defined thresholds and state variables.
    
- ModulationPolicy defines feedback gain, inhibition, and damping factors to avoid instability.
    

## Postconditions

- Neurons propagate activations through recursive feedback paths.
    
- Stabilization ensures functional oscillations (brain waves, signal patterns) without runaway excitation or signal collapse.
    
- System self-regulates through feedback loop adjustments (adaptive plasticity in biological systems, dynamic weights in AI networks).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **FeedbackStabilization Constructs** in recursive neural systems.
    
- Demonstrates how difference propagation is modulated dynamically through feedback loops, balancing excitation and inhibition.
    
- Bridges biological neural circuits and AI recurrent architectures within a unified difference-driven framework.
