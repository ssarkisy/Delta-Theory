# Thermostat Feedback Loop Control Rule (spec)

## Definition

**`Thermostat Feedback Loop Control Rule`** is a formal **control rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (temperature deviations)** propagate through a **feedback stabilization loop**, enabling dynamic state adjustments to maintain system coherence (e.g., room temperature).

It governs:
- **Detection of system difference (temperature deviation from target)**
- **Conditional activation of corrective actions (heater on/off)**
- **Recursive re-evaluation after state transitions**

This Spec ensures that difference propagation is **modulated through recursive feedback cycles** to stabilize the system within acceptable bounds.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆T`|Primitive Difference|Current temperature deviation from target setpoint|
|`T_target`|Target Value|Desired temperature threshold|
|`T_current`|System State|Current measured temperature|
|`FeedbackInterval`|Time|Interval for recursive evaluation of system state|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Action|Control Signal|Instruction to activate/deactivate heater|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether system difference is within acceptable tolerance|

## Formal Expression

Control Rule:
$$
Action =
\begin{cases}
\text{Activate Heater} & \text{if} \quad T_{current} < T_{target} \\
\text{Deactivate Heater} & \text{if} \quad T_{current} \geq T_{target}
\end{cases}
$$

Recursive Feedback Loop:
$$
\forall t \in FeedbackInterval: \quad Evaluate(∆T) \rightarrow Adjust(Action) \rightarrow Re-evaluate(∆T)
$$

Stabilization Condition:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad |T_{current} - T_{target}| \leq \epsilon
$$

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$T_{current}$|Current measured temperature|
|$T_{target}$|Desired setpoint temperature|
|$∆T$|Temperature deviation (difference)|
|$\epsilon$|Acceptable tolerance range|

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
loop every FeedbackInterval:
    ∆T = T_target - T_current
    if ∆T > epsilon:
        activate heater
    else:
        deactivate heater
    wait FeedbackInterval
````

## Preconditions

- A measurable system state difference (∆T) exists.
    
- The control loop has access to reliable feedback (temperature sensor input).
    
- Actuator (heater) must be responsive to control signals within acceptable latency.
    

## Postconditions

- The system will recursively adjust heater state to minimize ∆T.
    
- If FeedbackInterval and system response times are tuned correctly, the system will stabilize within defined tolerances.
    
- Feedback cycles continue indefinitely or until an external override occurs.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **FeedbackStabilization Constructs** by defining how system differences are recursively evaluated and modulated.
    
- Demonstrates recursive feedback loop dynamics as a **difference control mechanism**.
    
- Bridges from simple difference propagation into **dynamic systemic regulation through feedback cycles**.
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation| |---|---|---| |Home Thermostat|Maintains room temperature by recursively evaluating current state against desired setpoint| |Control Systems|Applies to any feedback-regulated process (e.g., climate control, process automation)| |Biological Regulation|Analogous to homeostatic feedback in biological systems (e.g., body temperature control)|
