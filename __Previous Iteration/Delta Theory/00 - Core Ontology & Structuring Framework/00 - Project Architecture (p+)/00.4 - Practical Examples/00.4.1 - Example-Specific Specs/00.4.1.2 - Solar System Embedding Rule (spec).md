# SolarSystemEmbeddingRule (spec)

## Definition

**`SolarSystemEmbeddingRule`** is a formal **embedding rule** that defines **how Primitive Differences (planets, Sun, moons)** are spatially structured into a **physical Solar System model** through **recursive layering of orbits**.

It governs:
- **Placement of celestial bodies around a central anchor (Sun)**.
- **Sequence of embedding layers (planets → moons → belts)**.
- **Alignment and stabilization checks ensuring a coherent, understandable structure**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆`|Primitive Difference|Planet, Sun, moon, or belt element|
|`Fⱼ₋₁`|Form|Current stage of the Solar System model|
|`OrbitLevel`|Integer|Embedding depth (planetary orbit, satellite orbit, etc.)|
|`AlignmentPlane`|Spatial Constraint|Defines the plane of orbit embedding (e.g., flat ecliptic plane)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Fⱼ|Form|Updated model state with ∆ embedded|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether placement preserves spatial coherence|

## Embedding Condition (Simplified)

$$
Fⱼ := Fⱼ₋₁ + ∆ \quad \text{iff} \quad ∆ \text{ is placed at correct orbit level within alignment plane}
$$

Recursive Structuring Flow:
$$
Sun \rightarrow Planets \rightarrow Moons \rightarrow Belts \quad \text{(recursive embedding layers)}
$$

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$∆$|Celestial body being placed in model|
|$Fⱼ$|Resulting structure after embedding|
|OrbitLevel|Recursion depth (0 = Sun, 1 = Planet, 2 = Moon, etc.)|
|AlignmentPlane|Common orbital plane (e.g., tabletop surface)|

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆ in solar_system_elements:
    if ∆'s orbit level and position align with AlignmentPlane constraints:
        embed ∆ into model structure (Fⱼ)
    else:
        reject placement (visual inconsistency)
````

## Preconditions

- Central anchor (Sun) is placed as base point.
    
- Orbit paths are defined visually (sticks, wires, drawn circles).
    
- Embedding sequence follows hierarchical order (stars → planets → satellites).
    

## Postconditions

- The model forms a clear, layered spatial structure.
    
- Recursive embeddings (e.g., moons) maintain nested relational coherence.
    
- Structural coherence is preserved — no orbit crossings, overlaps, or alignment breaks.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Materializes **RecursiveEmbedding Constructs** in a tangible spatial system.
    
- Demonstrates **difference structuring through recursive spatial layers**.
    
- Prepares for understanding more abstract recursive embeddings in non-physical domains (information networks, conceptual hierarchies).
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation| 
|---|---|
|School Projects|Students build a visual mock-up of the Solar System, respecting relational embeddings|
|Educational Visualization|Helps explain how orbital systems scale through recursive layering|
|Metaphoric Systems Design|Used as a metaphor for nested structures in organizational charts or information architectures|
