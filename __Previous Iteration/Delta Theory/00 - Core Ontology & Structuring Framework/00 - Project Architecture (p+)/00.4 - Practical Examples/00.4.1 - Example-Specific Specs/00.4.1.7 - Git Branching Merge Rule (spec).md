# GitBranchingMergeRule (spec)

## Definition

**`GitBranchingMergeRule`** is a formal **recursive difference propagation rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (commits, branches)** are embedded into hierarchical structures and stabilized through **branching and merging operations** within a version control system.

It governs:
- **Commit propagation sequences (recursive embedding of changesets)**.
- **Branching logic for divergent development paths**.
- **Merge operations as stabilization events resolving difference conflicts**.
- **Recursive state evaluations ensuring coherence of the repository’s structure**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_commit`|Primitive Difference|Atomic changeset (commit) encapsulating code modifications|
|`Branch`|RecursiveEmbedding|Current embedding path (branch chain)|
|`MergeTarget`|Form|Target branch or commit node for merge stabilization|
|`ConflictResolutionPolicy`|Spec|Rule set defining how to resolve overlapping changes during merges|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|RepositoryState|Form|Updated stabilized version control structure|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether branching and merge operations preserved system coherence|

## Branching Condition

Branch Creation:
$$
Branch_{n} := Branch_{n-1} + ∆_{commit} \quad \text{iff} \quad ∆_{commit} \text{ extends an existing embedding path}
$$

Divergence Embedding:
$$
Branch_{feature} := Fork(Branch_{main}) \quad \text{initiating recursive divergence of difference propagation}
$$

## Merge Stabilization Condition

Merge Operation:
$$
Branch_{main} := Merge(Branch_{main}, Branch_{feature}) \quad \text{iff} \quad ConflictResolutionPolicy(∆_{diffs}) = Resolved
$$

Stabilization is successful if:
$$
RepositoryState = Coherent \quad \land \quad No_Residual_Conflicts
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆_commit:
    embed ∆ into current Branch chain
    if branching event triggered:
        create new Branch path (recursive divergence)
    if merging into another Branch:
        evaluate differences using ConflictResolutionPolicy
        if conflicts resolved:
            stabilize into merged RepositoryState
        else:
            embedding fails (structural conflict persists)
````

## Preconditions

- Each commit (∆_commit) is atomic and uniquely identifiable.
    
- Branch chains maintain relational embedding integrity (commit history flow).
    
- Merge operations must resolve difference conflicts according to specified policies.
    

## Postconditions

- The repository evolves as a recursive difference structure (commit DAG).
    
- Successful merges stabilize divergent embeddings back into coherent paths.
    
- Unresolved conflicts halt stabilization, requiring manual reconciliation.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveEmbedding Constructs** in time-embedded difference tracking systems.
    
- Demonstrates how difference propagates through recursive divergence (branches) and resolves through stabilization events (merges).
    
- Exemplifies recursive system integrity through continuous state evaluations (merge conflicts as structural tests).
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Software Development|Tracking changes across multiple developers, branching features, stabilizing through merges|
|Collaborative Writing|Version branching and reconciliation of document edits|
|Distributed Systems|Modeling recursive divergence and convergence of system states (e.g., distributed consensus algorithms)|
