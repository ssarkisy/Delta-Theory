# FieldLineStabilizationRule (spec)

## Definition

**`FieldLineStabilizationRule`** is a formal **embedding and stabilization rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (charges, masses, field sources)** propagate into **continuous field line structures**, aligning under spatial constraints to maintain systemic coherence (e.g., flux balance, divergence-free conditions).

It governs:
- **How difference vectors propagate from sources into space**.
- **Field line embedding sequences ensuring relational alignment**.
- **Stabilization checks to maintain coherence across recursive field embeddings**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_source`|Primitive Difference|Charge, mass, or other field-generating entity|
|`Fⱼ₋₁`|Form|Current state of the field structure before embedding new field lines|
|`EmbeddingVector`|RelationalEmbedding|Direction and magnitude of difference propagation at a given point in space|
|`BoundaryConditions`|Spec|Spatial constraints defining permissible field configurations (e.g., Gauss's law, conservation laws)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Fⱼ|Form|Updated field structure with embedded, stabilized field lines|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether field configuration remains coherent (no divergence, flux balance maintained)|

## Embedding Condition

Field Line Propagation:
$$
Fⱼ := Fⱼ₋₁ + ∆_{line} \quad \text{iff} \quad ∆_{line} \text{ aligns with EmbeddingVector constraints}
$$

Stabilization Condition:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad \sum Flux_{in} = \sum Flux_{out} \quad \land \quad \nabla \cdot F = 0 \quad \text{(where applicable)}
$$

Recursive Embedding:
$$
Fₙ := R^n(∆₀) \quad \text{with iterative field line addition preserving coherence}
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆_source in field_sources:
    generate EmbeddingVectors radiating outward
    for each vector direction:
        if BoundaryConditions allow:
            embed field line into current field structure (Fⱼ)
        else:
            adjust embedding path (curve, loop back, cancel)
    after embedding:
        evaluate flux balance and divergence conditions (Stabilization)
````

## Preconditions

- Field sources (charges, masses) are positioned and defined.
    
- Spatial constraints (BoundaryConditions) are specified.
    
- Recursive embedding logic defines how new field lines integrate into existing structure.
    

## Postconditions

- Successful embedding sequences result in a stable field line structure.
    
- Stabilization ensures no divergence inconsistencies, and field lines maintain coherent flow (e.g., magnetic loops, radial electric fields).
    
- Recursive embeddings can model complex structures (e.g., field braiding, null points).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Demonstrates **Recursive Embedding Constructs** in continuous fields.
    
- Operationalizes difference propagation from discrete sources into **structured spatial forms (fields)**.
    
- Provides a foundation for **recursive field interactions**, essential for modeling multi-source systems, complex field topologies, and flux dynamics.
