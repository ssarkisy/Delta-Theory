# 00 – Project Overview

This note defines the **structural role of the 00 – Project folder** in the ∆‑Theory Knowledge Base. It serves as the **foundational architecture layer**, containing all meta-notes, templates, theoretical frameworks, domain reflections, and practical examples that guide the creation, maintenance, and scaling of the system.


## Purpose of the 00 – Project Folder

- **Houses all meta-level content** related to the Knowledge Base architecture.
    
- Defines the **rules, structures, and methodologies** used to maintain coherence across Ontology, Spec, Model, and Domain layers.
    
- Serves as a **knowledge scaffolding layer**, ensuring clarity in:
    
    - File types & naming conventions.
        
    - Structural traceability principles.
        
    - Roadmaps and developmental plans.
        
    - Cross-domain reflections and practical modeling examples.
        

## Folder Structure Breakdown

|Subfolder|Purpose|
|---|---|
|**00.0 – Templates**|Provides note templates for Ontology, Spec, Model, Property, and Construct notes.|
|**00.1 – Project Overview**|Defines the project’s purpose, workspace setup, architectural rules, and development roadmap.|
|**00.2 – Theoretical Foundations**|Core conceptual frameworks — geometry of difference, closure models, complexity principles.|
|**00.3 – Domain Reflections**|Cross-domain applications of ∆‑Theory (graphics, cognition, systems).|
|**00.4 – Practical Examples**|Real-world model examples illustrating difference propagation and stabilization, with example-specific Specs.|

## Navigation Logic

- All **Meta Notes** governing file structures, naming rules, templates, and traceability are rooted here.
    
- High-level theoretical constructs that **anchor the Ontology layer conceptually** are stored in **Theoretical Foundations**.
    
- Practical examples and domain-specific reflections reside in **Examples** and **Reflections**, maintaining clear separation between **conceptual architecture** and **applied instances**.
    


## Relation to Knowledge Base Structure

|Layer|Relation|
|---|---|
|Ontology|Defines structural primitives and configurations — Project notes scaffold how they are documented and linked.|
|Spec|Project notes define Spec types, naming rules, and traceability chains.|
|Model|Practical Examples in the Project folder serve as initial Model instantiations.|
|Meta|Project folder is the core Meta layer from which all other layers inherit structural consistency.|
