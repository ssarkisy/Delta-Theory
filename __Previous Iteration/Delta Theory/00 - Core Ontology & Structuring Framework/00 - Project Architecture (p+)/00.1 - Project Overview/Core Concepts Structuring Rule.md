# Core Concepts Structuring Rule (∆‑Theory Domains)

## Purpose

This governance note defines the **structural role of Core Concepts folders (X.0)** in Domain Layers (Physics, Chemistry, Biology, etc.) within Delta Theory Vault.

It outlines **why and how Core Concepts can include both properties and primitive constructs**, serving as the **recursive ontomolecule seed scaffold** for each domain’s propagation dynamics.

## Principle

> **Core Concepts (X.0) represent the minimal recursive propagation field configuration of a domain.**
> 
> They define **the ontological difference substrate** through which the domain’s recursive structures (constructs, models) emerge.


## Folder Role in Domain Architecture

|Folder Level|Function|
|---|---|
|**X.0 - Core Concepts**|Minimal ∆-substrate seed defining essential properties & primitive constructs.|
|**X.1 - Recursive Constructs**|Functional loops and feedback structures derived from Core Concepts.|
|**X.2 - Properties & Diagnostics**|Detailed qualifiers and stability metrics for recursive domain structures.|
|**X.3 - Domain Models**|Full recursive form instantiations specific to the domain.|
|**X.Z - What’s Missing**|Recursive scaffolding gaps & development backlog.|

## What is Allowed in Core Concepts

|Type|Included?|Explanation|
|---|---|---|
|**Primitive Properties**|✅|Essential structural qualifiers required for domain propagation (e.g., Phase Locking in Physics).|
|**Seed Constructs / Loops**|✅|Minimal recursive dynamic constructs foundational to the domain (e.g., Recursive Mass & Identity).|
|**Field Configurations**|✅|Difference propagation fields (e.g., Field (DeltaRelational)) that define the domain substrate.|
|**Fully Instantiated Models**|❌|Models like Proton, Electron belong to **Domain Models (X.3)**, not Core Concepts.|
|**Complex Recursive Dynamics**|❌|Feedback loops, coupling chains, modulation dynamics go to **Recursive Constructs (X.1)**.|

## Why Properties Are Included Here?

- In Domain Layers (Physics, Chemistry, etc.), **certain properties are not mere qualifiers — they are ontological necessity conditions**.
    
- For instance:
    
    - **Phase Locking** is a primitive dynamic that must exist for quantum coherence.
        
    - **Ontological Energy** is the substrate modulation field for propagation.
        
- Thus, they must be defined in **Core Concepts**, not buried under diagnostics.
    
## Cross-Layer Reflection Rule

1. **Ontology (10)** — strict separation of Properties ↔ Constructs.
    
2. **Domain Layers (50, 51, …)** — Core Concepts define the **seed scaffold**, allowing properties + seed constructs.
    
3. **Recursive Constructs (X.1)** — complex functional loops emerge from Core Concepts.
    
4. **Models (X.3)** — applied recursive instantiations.
    

## Structuring Pattern Summary

```plaintext
X.0 - Core Concepts/
    - Primitive Properties (difference substrate)
    - Seed Recursive Constructs (minimal propagation loops)
    - Field Configurations (propagation fields)
```

## Notes

- Always ensure that each concept in **Core Concepts** is a **structural necessity for domain propagation**, not a derived property.
    
- Derived properties, detailed diagnostics, and interaction qualifiers go into **X.2 - Properties & Diagnostics**.
