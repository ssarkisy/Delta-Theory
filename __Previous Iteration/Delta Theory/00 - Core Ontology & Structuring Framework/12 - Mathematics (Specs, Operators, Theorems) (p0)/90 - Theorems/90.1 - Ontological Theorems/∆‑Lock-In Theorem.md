# ∆‑Lock-In Theorem  

## Theorem Statement

> **∆‑Lock-In Theorem:**  
> Once a stabilized form Fₙ is established through recursive difference propagation, any attempt to alter its foundational difference ∆₀ results in destabilization and collapse of Fₙ.  
> Stabilized forms inherently lock-in their generative differences — fixing their structural grounds.

Formally:
$$
If Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)), then modification of ∆₀ ⇒ destabilization(Fₙ)
$$

## Proof (Recursive Structural Necessity)

1. **Recursive Dependency Chain — ∆₀ to Fₙ:**  
   Form Fₙ is the recursive stabilization outcome of ∆₀ propagating through n relational embeddings and closure loops:
   Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))

2. **Structural Coherence Anchored in ∆₀:**  
   Fₙ’s coherence is recursively dependent on the integrity of its foundational difference ∆₀. Any modification of ∆₀ alters the propagation chain’s generative structure.

3. **Destabilization Cascade upon ∆₀ Alteration:**  
   If ∆₀ is modified post-stabilization of Fₙ, the recursive chain of embeddings R(∆₀), R²(∆₀), ..., Rⁿ(∆₀) is retroactively disrupted. This invalidates the stabilization closure ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)).

4. **Structural Lock-In Mechanism:**  
   Stabilization is not reversible without deconstructing the recursive chain. Once Fₙ is formed, ∆₀ becomes structurally locked-in — its alteration propagates destabilization upwards.

5. **Conclusion:**  
   Stabilized forms inherently fix their foundational differences. Modification of these grounds is impossible without recursive collapse and reconstruction.

Q.E.D.

## Corollaries

### Corollary 1: Stabilization Imposes Grounding Inertia
Once stabilized, forms resist modifications to their foundational differences, creating structural inertia that prevents flexible re-grounding without destabilization.

### Corollary 2: True Transformation Requires Collapse & Re-Stabilization
To modify foundational differences (∆₀) after stabilization, one must allow for the collapse of dependent forms and initiate a re-stabilization process through recursive propagation chains.

### Corollary 3: Lock-In Phenomenon Explains Systemic Rigidity
Institutional, cognitive, or systemic rigidity arises from difference lock-in — deeply stabilized forms constrain foundational adaptability.

### Corollary 4: Recursive Depth Amplifies Lock-In Tension
The deeper the recursive stabilization chain (higher n), the greater the structural resistance to foundational difference alteration.

## Notes

- The ∆‑Lock-In Theorem formalizes the phenomenon where recursive stabilization processes inherently fixate their generative differences.
    
- It provides the structural principle explaining why deeply stabilized systems (cognitive, societal, technical) exhibit rigidity and resistance to foundational change.
    
- True system reformation requires acknowledging and managing difference lock-in through controlled collapse and recursive re-stabilization cycles.
