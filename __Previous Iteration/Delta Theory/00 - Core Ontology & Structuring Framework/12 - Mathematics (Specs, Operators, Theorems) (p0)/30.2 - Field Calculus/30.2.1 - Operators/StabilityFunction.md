# S(Fₙ) — Stability Function

## Explanation / Definition

`S(Fₙ)` defines the **stability of a form** `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` under recursive and field modulation. It evaluates how long and how reliably a difference structure maintains its integrity in the presence of recursive feedback and external conditions.

> It’s a **field-aware scalar function** that encodes a form’s ability to hold across time, perturbation, and spatial displacement.

This function helps model the **temporal durability**, **collapse probability**, and **mass persistence** of stabilized forms in ∆‑space.

## Formal Expression (Prototype)

Let `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` and let the environment be modulated by `⊚Field(x)` and other local forces.

Then:
$S(Fₙ) ∝ PathPersistence(Rⁿ) × ClosureStrength(Fₙ) × τ(x) × (1 / C(x))$

Where:
- `PathPersistence(Rⁿ)` = duration of recursive chain propagation
- `ClosureStrength(Fₙ)` = loop integrity of the structure
- `τ(x)` = local phase alignment
- `C(x)` = collapse curvature — higher curvature → lower stability

This captures the **interplay** of internal coherence and environmental difficulty.

## Core Roles

| Feature             | Description                                             |
|---------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal durability | Indicates how long the form persists                    |
| Collapse resistance | Higher `S(Fₙ)` = less prone to structural failure       |
| Phase anchoring     | Stability affects the local ∆‑topology around `Fₙ`      |
| Mass formulation    | Core in modeling persistence of “matter-like” forms     |

## Examples / Case Studies

| System         | Interpretation                                                       |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Proton         | High `S(Fₙ)` due to deep nesting + strong closure + low C(x)         |
| Neutron decay  | Reduced `S(Fₙ)` when field modulation weakens closure or phase sync  |
| Memetic idea   | Social or cognitive idea with high internal feedback = high S(Fₙ)    |
| Quark cluster  | Meta-stable partial loop — `S(Fₙ)` varies with ∆-pressure and depth  |

## Future Directions

- Define **S‑thresholds** for collapse (`S < ε`)
- Investigate `∂S / ∂t` and `∂S / ∂⊚Field(x)` — rate of structural decay
- Build stabilogram maps over ∆‑fields to visualize stability topologies
