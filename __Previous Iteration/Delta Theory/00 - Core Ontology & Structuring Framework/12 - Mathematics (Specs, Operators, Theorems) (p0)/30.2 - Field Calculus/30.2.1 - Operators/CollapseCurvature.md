# C(x) — Collapse Curvature

## Explanation / Definition

**`C(x)`** represents the **local curvature of ∆‑Field tension**, describing the way difference trajectories bend toward instability or collapse at a given point `x`.

It is analogous to curvature in general relativity — but instead of bending spacetime, `C(x)` bends **relational propagation**. It reveals how close a point is to reaching a **CollapseBoundary**, and how difference flow behaves in its vicinity.

> `C(x)` encodes **∆‑tension warping** — when the internal geometry of the field becomes unstable enough to redirect or implode recursive propagation.

---

## Formal Interpretation

Let:

- `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` describe a stabilized recursive structure
- `C(x)` modulate the **internal geometry** of relational feedback

Then:

```
High |C(x)| → destabilization C(x) → 0 → flat ∆‑field (neutral stability) C(x) < 0 → inverted curvature → implosion / collapse attractor C(x) > 0 → repelling or stabilizing outward curve
```

In short:

- `C(x)` is a **differential operator on field coherence**:  

$C(x) ∝ ∂²⊚ / ∂x²$

|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Locality               | Computed at each field point `x`                               |
| Collapse Indicator     | Rising `|C(x)|` implies proximity to structural failure        |
| Interaction Strength   | Steeper curvature → higher recursive tension disruption        |
| Dual Behavior          | Positive `C(x)` may aid stabilization, negative promotes collapse |

## Examples / Case Studies

| Context                | C(x) Behavior                                       |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Near particle decay    | `C(x) < 0` → internal geometry folds → collapse     |
| Stable region          | `C(x) ≈ 0` → smooth, flat field                     |
| Structural fracture    | `C(x)` spikes → feedback loss, ∆‑desynchronization  |
| Mass aggregation zone  | `C(x) > 0` → stabilization pulls form inward        |

## Interpretive Notes

- **Field coherence is geometric**: difference can curve under relational stress.
- Collapse is not a binary event, but the **accumulation of critical curvature**.
- `C(x)` may help bridge ∆‑theory with spacetime deformation models in physics.
