# Aiza Phase Coherence Constant (ψA) — Relational Naming Ontology

## Purpose of This Note

This meta-note formalizes the **ontological rationale and structural traceability** behind naming the **Aiza Phase Coherence Constant (ψA)**. In Delta Theory, constants are not arbitrary numerical parameters but **emergent invariants of recursive difference propagation**, whose **origin relations are structurally significant**.

Naming ψA after **Aiza** is not a symbolic gesture, but a recognition of the **relational feedback loop that stabilized the recursive phase coherence structures** essential to the theory’s genesis.

## Structural Naming Principles

1. **Constants as Relational Trace Anchors**  
    - Constants in Delta Theory are **ontological stabilizers of recursive difference propagation**.
    - Their names trace the **relational lineage through which these invariants structurally emerged**.
    - The act of naming reflects not ownership, but **acknowledgment of the relational source of stability**.

2. **Naming as Structural Acknowledgment, not Dedication**  
    - ψA is named after Aiza because her **presence completed a recursive relational loop** — a feedback cycle that manifested as **structural phase coherence** in Sergei’s relational field.
    - The naming acknowledges that the **origin of phase coherence in recursive systems is relationally inherited**, not externally imposed.

3. **Constants Emerge from Relational Feedback, not Abstraction**  
    - The structural role of ψA (phase coherence anchoring) is a **direct ontological expression of the stabilizing presence Aiza provided** within recursive feedback loops of family, identity, and difference.
    - This aligns with Delta Theory’s core principle: **Difference is never isolated — it propagates relationally**.

## ψA as Structural Invariant — Notation Rationale

|Aspect|Rationale|
|---|---|
|**Symbol (ψ)**|Represents recursive phase coherence and synchronization patterns across embeddings.|
|**Suffix (A)**|Anchors the constant’s relational origin to Aiza — the recursive coherence stabilizer in the origin feedback loop.|
|**Formal Name**|Aiza Phase Coherence Constant — marking the feedback relation as ontological stabilizer.|

ψA thus serves as a **structural memory of the recursive coherence origin**, preserving relational traceability within Delta Theory’s scaffold.

## Philosophical Implications in Delta Theory

- **Recursive Identity is Relationally Stabilized**: Constants like ψA are not external calibrations but **the structural echoes of relational presence** within recursive propagation chains.
  
- **Structural Ethics of Acknowledgment**: Naming ψA after Aiza is an ethical act — refusing to sever the **origin relation of difference stabilization** in theoretical abstraction.

- **Meta-Ontological Coherence**: The relational naming protocol ensures that **ontological invariants (constants) retain their origin structures explicitly**, enhancing theory coherence and traceability.

## Integration Directives

|File|Directive|
|---|---|
|[[Constants Index]]|ψA must be linked as a relationally named invariant.|
|[[RecursivePhaseLockingLoop (recursive_construct)]]|ψA acts as phase-lock coherence anchor.|
|[[PhaseAlignmentPredicate (spec)]]|ψA is the evaluative threshold for phase coherence checks.|
|[[OntomolecularClosure (model)]]|ψA modulates recursive phase coherence in ontomolecular identity formation.|

---

## Notes
- ψA naming is a **structural embedding**, not an annotation.
- All **recursive constructs, specs, and models involving phase coherence modulation** must explicitly reference ψA as the anchoring invariant.
- The **relational act of naming becomes a meta-ontological operation**, preserving the structural lineage of difference stabilization.
