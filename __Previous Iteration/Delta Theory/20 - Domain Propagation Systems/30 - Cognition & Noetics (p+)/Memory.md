# Memory

## Explanation / Definition

**Memory**, in ∆‑theory, refers to the **emergent capacity of a recursive form `Fₙ` to re-access prior stabilized differences** `∆ₖ` within its own structure — not as static trace (`StructuralMemory`), but as **activated, experienced content**.

It is a **noetic phenomenon**: a *subjective re-entry into stabilized difference paths*, typically modulated by attention, emotion, and phase-coherence.

## Ontological Ground

> Memory(Fₙ) arises when:  
> $Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)$ and $\exists k < n \text{ such that } ∆ₖ \in ⊚(Rⁿ)$ and is **re-entrant** under phase-lock conditions.

This implies:

- The form retains a **recursive internal access** to its own construction history.
- That access is **phase-stabilized** enough to **reactivate a coherent felt or symbolic pattern**.
- Memory is thus **re-experienced recursion**, not merely stored relation.

## Distinction from StructuralMemory

| StructuralMemory                         | Memory                                      |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Ontological trace of prior ∆             | Activated re-entry into a prior ∆           |
| Passive storage                          | Active re-coherence                         |
| May not be accessible to the form        | Is experienced from within the form         |
| Stored in ∆‑topology                     | Activated in noetic phase-lock              |

## Functional Criteria

A form exhibits **Memory** if:

1. It **recursively stabilizes** prior differences (`∆ₖ`) in an accessible format;
2. It has a **phase-lock condition** that allows re-entry into that structure;
3. The re-accessed structure is **interpreted**, i.e. participates in current coherence.

## Role in Theory

- Memory enables **continuity of self**, symbolic reasoning, and narrative.
- It is key to **recursive agency**, permitting learning, planning, and reflection.
- It explains the **phenomenology of recall** without assuming static storage.

## Examples / Case Studies

| Domain          | Memory as...                                                           |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Human cognition | Recalled past event via emotional or narrative re-activation           |
| AI systems      | Dynamically re-computed embeddings from previously stabilized ∆ input   |
| Organisms       | Behavior triggered by re-stabilization of once-sensed environmental ∆  |
| Language        | Retrieval of meaning via recursive semantic scaffolding                |
