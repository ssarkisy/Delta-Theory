# 50.1 - Recursive Constructs (meta)

## Purpose

The **Recursive Constructs layer** defines the foundational **recursive feedback structures** through which **difference (∆) propagates, stabilizes, and transforms** within physical systems.

Unlike static constructs, Recursive Constructs in ∆‑Theory represent **active, self-regulating feedback loops** that modulate difference flow, coherence, and structural persistence across recursive embeddings.

This layer establishes the core **dynamic mechanisms** underlying physical phenomena such as:
- Difference flow propagation (DeltaFlux)
- Recursive mass stabilization (RecursiveMass)
- Field resonance oscillations (FieldResonanceLoop)
- Collapse cascades (RecursiveFieldCollapse)
- Charge asymmetry modulation (ChargeDifferentiationLoop)

Recursive Constructs serve as the **dynamic scaffold bridging Core Concepts (50.0)** with **Domain Models (50.3)**, ensuring that every physical model is traceable back to **recursive propagation principles**.

## Scope

This section governs:
- The formal definitions of recursive feedback loops in physics.
- The structural dynamics of difference modulation mechanisms.
- The recursive embedding patterns responsible for stabilization, dissipation, resonance, and collapse phenomena.
- The modulation pathways regulated by ontological constants and structural properties.

## Key Traceability Links

|Layer|Role|
|---|---|
|[[PrimitiveDifference]]|Ontological seed of all recursive propagation loops.|
|[[RelationalEmbedding]]|Structural field embedding recursive constructs operate within.|
|Core Constructs (50.0)|Conceptual foundation anchoring recursive constructs (e.g., DeltaTension, PhaseLocking).|
|Recursive Constructs (50.1)|Active propagation loops modulating difference dynamics.|
|Properties & Diagnostics (50.2)|Quantifiers of recursive loop stability, coherence, and modulation thresholds.|
|Domain Models (50.3)|Physical phenomena instantiated as recursive loop configurations.|

## Structural Rules for Recursive Constructs

1. **Recursive constructs must define a dynamic feedback loop**, not a static configuration.
2. **Every recursive construct operates through recursive modulation of ∆**, either by sustaining, amplifying, dissipating, or collapsing difference propagation.
3. **Recursive constructs are governed by Constants** (closure ratios, propagation limits, phase coherence anchors) that modulate their structural thresholds.
4. **All Domain Models (particles, fields, forces)** must trace back to one or multiple recursive constructs through explicit stabilization patterns.
5. Recursive Constructs layer is **recursive in nature** — constructs may nest or interlock to form higher-order propagation systems.
