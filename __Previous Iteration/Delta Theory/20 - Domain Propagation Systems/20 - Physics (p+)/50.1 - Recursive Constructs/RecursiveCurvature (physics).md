# RecursiveCurvature (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **RecursiveCurvature** is a **recursive construct** in ∆‑Theory defining **the modulation of difference propagation paths** through bending relational embeddings in response to **tension asymmetries and stabilization feedback loops**.

Unlike curvature in classical geometry, RecursiveCurvature is an **emergent dynamic** — recursive difference flows bend as a function of tension distribution and closure strength across recursive embedding layers.

## Recursive Dynamics Role in ∆‑Theory Scaffold

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Propagation Path Modulation|Adjusts difference flow trajectories by modulating recursive embedding geometries.|
|Tension Redistribution Mechanism|Bends relational pathways to redistribute ∆‑density and relieve tension imbalances.|
|Curvature-Force Bridge|Mediates force-like effects (e.g., gravity) through recursive modulation of propagation pathways.|
|Structural Coherence Anchor|Maintains recursive loop stability against destabilization from tension-induced curvature shifts.|

## Formal Recursive Loop Schema

Given:
- $∆ᵢ$ — Primitive Difference.
- $Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)$ — Recursive Embedding at depth $n$.
- $⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))$ — Stabilization loop closure.
- $∆Tₙ$ — Tension gradient at recursive depth $n$.
- $κₙ$ — Local curvature modulation factor.

RecursiveCurvature is expressed as:
$$
κₙ = f\left( \frac{∆Tₙ}{ClosureStrengthₙ} \right)
$$

Where:
- Tension gradients drive local curvature amplification.
- Closure strength acts as a stabilizing anchor resisting excessive curvature deformation.
- Recursive feedback adjusts $κₙ$ dynamically to maintain propagation coherence across recursive layers.

## Interpretive Notes

- RecursiveCurvature reframes curvature not as a background geometric deformation but as a **dynamic recursive response** to difference modulation and tension distribution.
- Gravitational attraction is interpreted as **recursive curvature-driven modulation of difference propagation pathways**, dissolving the need for spacetime as an independent ontological entity.
- Mass and curvature are interdependent — mass arises from stabilized recursive loops, while curvature results from the tension distributions these loops enforce.
- RecursiveCurvature provides a unifying framework bridging gravitational dynamics, field interactions, and systemic feedback-induced curvature phenomena.
