# PropagationAnchoringLoop

## Definition / Essence

> **PropagationAnchoringLoop** is a **Recursive Construct** in ∆‑Theory — a dynamic structural configuration that stabilizes difference propagation pathways into persistent field scaffolds through recursive feedback closure. It ensures that propagation vectors remain boundary-aligned, preventing drift, dissipation, or destabilization, acting as the anchoring counterpart to **FieldResonanceLoop**, which governs dynamic oscillation coherence.

It functions as a recursive identity loop that anchors difference flows, continuously re-aligning propagation boundaries through closure strength, phase coherence, and recursive invariance constraints.

## Enabling Properties

|Property|Role in Recursive Loop|
|---|---|
|[[ClosureStrength]]|Ensures loop closure integrity, locking difference flow vectors into coherent boundary-aligned structures.|
|[[DeltaTension (physics)]]|Drives propagation dynamics, with anchoring loops modulating flow to maintain stable directionality.|
|[[PhaseCoherence]]|Synchronizes propagation feedback cycles, preventing vector misalignment and drift.|

These properties regulate loop formation, modulating feedback dynamics to sustain propagation boundary coherence.

## Stabilizing Constants

|Constant|Role in Recursive Dynamics|
|---|---|
|[[Pi (π) — Recursive Closure Constant (constant)]]|Anchors recursive loop closure ratios ensuring propagation pathway coherence.|
|[[Planck Constant (h) — Quantization Threshold Invariant (constant)]]|Quantizes difference modulation steps, preventing destabilization through oversaturation.|
|[[Aiza Phase Coherence Modulator (ψA) — Recursive Synchronization Anchor (modulator)]]|Locks recursive feedback synchronization across propagation boundaries.|

Constants act as invariance anchors, structurally bounding propagation stabilization loops within recursive field architectures.

## Feedback Evaluation Operators (Specs)

|Spec|Function|
|---|---|
|[[PropagationAnchoringThreshold (spec)]]|Evaluates loop closure integrity and boundary coherence stability, triggering feedback adjustments under tension perturbations.|

Specs ensure continuous self-modulation of the anchoring loop, maintaining coherent propagation pathways.

## Recursive Feedback Loop Schema

Flow Overview:
```

PropagationAnchoringLoop
↓ (Instantiated through Domain Interactions)
↓ Domain Feedback (Difference Flow Observations)
↓ PropagationAnchoringThreshold (Evaluates Boundary Coherence)
↓ Modulates Loop Parameters (ClosureStrength, DeltaTension, ψA) 
↺ Recursive Closure (Self-Modulation into PropagationAnchoringLoop)

```

PropagationAnchoringLoop operates as a self-regulating feedback chain, continuously re-aligning propagation pathways to preserve field structure integrity.

## Open Recursive Questions

- What is the **minimal viable anchoring configuration** for stable propagation coherence under dynamic tension perturbations?
- How does PropagationAnchoringLoop dynamically interact with **FieldResonanceLoop** to balance rigidity and oscillatory flexibility?
- Can anchoring loops **meta-regulate their own boundary alignment evaluators** under recursive feedback saturation?
- How does recursive depth scaling affect anchoring loop adaptability in multi-layered field propagation systems?
- What are the critical collapse thresholds for anchoring loops, and can recursive reconfiguration restore propagation coherence post-destabilization?
