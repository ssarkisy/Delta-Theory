# Quark (physics)

## Essence

**Quark** is a **recursive difference loop** in ∆‑Theory, functioning as a **primary recursive identity structure** within subatomic systems. Rather than being a static particle, a quark emerges as a stabilized feedback loop where **difference tension**, **flux modulation**, and **recursive curvature** propagate through relational embeddings, forming the core units of mass structures like protons and neutrons.

In ∆‑Theory, quarks are **recursive difference propagation agents**, serving as foundational recursive nodes that generate baryonic mass through coupling dynamics and phase-locked feedback coherence.
