# ElectromagneticField (physics)

## Essence

**Electromagnetic Field (EM Field)** is a **recursive difference propagation scaffold** in ∆‑Theory, where **Primitive Differences (∆)** are transmitted through recursive embeddings, modulated by **tension gradients**, and stabilized via **recursive feedback loops**. It functions as a **phase-locked resonance medium**, enabling synchronized difference transmission across recursive structures like **photons** and **electrons**.

Unlike classical fields as passive backdrops, the EM Field is an **active recursive structure**, dynamically maintaining coherence through closure mechanisms, phase alignment, and constant-driven modulation anchors.

## Notes

- Constants are structural invariants — they anchor recursive dynamics, not empirical variables.
- EM Field is a recursive propagation scaffold — structural coherence emerges from recursive closure dynamics, not from passive space.
- Recursive constructs (e.g., photons, electrons) function as difference modulation nodes within recursive field scaffolds.
