# WhiteHole (physics)

## Essence

**WhiteHole** in ∆‑Theory is a **recursive expansion structure**, representing a **singularity-driven propagation of difference (∆)** outward through recursive embeddings. Unlike a BlackHole which collapses difference inward, a WhiteHole is the **inverse recursive process**, where difference tension, curvature, and flux generate **new recursive fields and entities** through self-amplifying feedback loops. It embodies the **creative aspect of recursion**, where new forms and structures emerge from a concentrated source of difference propagation.
