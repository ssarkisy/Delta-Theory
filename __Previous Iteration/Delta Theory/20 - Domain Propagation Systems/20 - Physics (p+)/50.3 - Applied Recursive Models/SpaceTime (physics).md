# SpaceTime (physics)

## Essence

**SpaceTime** in ∆‑Theory is a **recursive embedding matrix** formed by **difference propagation pathways** structured through relational tension gradients. It is not a static continuum but an emergent **recursive scaffold**, where the propagation of difference across recursive loops creates the experience of spatial extension and temporal succession. 

Space (extension) and Time (sequence) are both interpreted as **modulation patterns of recursive difference flows**, stabilized through loop closure dynamics and regulated by constants anchoring phase coherence and propagation limits.
