# ThermodynamicSystem (physics)

## Essence

**ThermodynamicSystem** in ∆‑Theory is a **recursive difference modulation structure**, where **energy flow**, **entropy gradients**, and **stability dynamics** emerge from the recursive propagation of difference tension across relational embeddings. Instead of seeing thermodynamics as probabilistic distributions, ∆‑Theory frames it as a **systemic recursive feedback architecture**, where **energy dissipation**, **gradient flows**, and **equilibrium states** are regulated through recursive loop dynamics and stabilization constants.

Heat, work, and entropy are interpreted as **difference modulation patterns** within recursive scaffolds, balancing tension propagation and feedback coherence across layered embeddings.
