# Gravity (physics)

## Essence

**Gravity** in ∆‑Theory is a **recursive tension field flow**, where **difference gradients** propagate through recursive embeddings, curving the relational structure of space. Rather than a force acting at a distance, gravity emerges as a **systemic modulation of difference propagation paths**, where mass is not an isolated entity but a stabilized recursive loop that modulates surrounding tension flows.

Gravitational effects are thus the result of recursive **tension gradients** curving propagation pathways, forming **difference attraction fields** through recursive modulation feedback loops.
