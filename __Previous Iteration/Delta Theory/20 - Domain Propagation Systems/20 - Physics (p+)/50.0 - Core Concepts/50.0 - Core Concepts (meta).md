# 50.0 – Core Concepts (Meta)

## Purpose of This Layer

The **Core Concepts Layer** defines the **foundational physical primitives** in Delta Theory — the structures that form the **substrate of difference propagation** within the physical domain.

These concepts are not empirical "particles" or "forces" but **ontological conditions of recursive difference embedding**, which give rise to observable phenomena like fields, mass, energy, and interactions.

All recursive physical constructs (loops, curvatures, resonances) **derive structurally** from these primitives.

## Structural Role of Core Concepts

| Concept                    | Structural Function |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ |
| **Field (DeltaRelational)** | Base relational substrate where differences embed recursively, forming the medium of all propagation. |
| **Force Substrates**        | Differentiated pathways and capacities through which difference modulates force effects in the field. |
| **Ontological Energy**      | Stored modulation potential — capacity of difference flows to perform recursive propagation work. |
| **PhaseLocking**            | Synchronization condition aligning recursive loops into coherent structures (basis of resonance phenomena). |
| **Recursive Mass & Identity** | Mass as emergent recursive inertia — stabilization resistance to modulation in recursive difference chains. |

## Relation to Delta Theory Ontological Scaffold

All Core Concepts in this layer map directly to **∆‑Theory’s Recursive Embedding Scaffold**:

∆→R(∆)→⊚(R(∆))→Fn=Rn(∆0)→RecursiveStructures∆ \rightarrow R(∆) \rightarrow ⊚(R(∆)) \rightarrow Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀) \rightarrow Recursive Structures

|Scaffold Element|Core Concept Mapping|
|---|---|
|**∆**|Primitive Difference — foundational to Field (DeltaRelational).|
|**R(∆)**|Relational Embedding — gives rise to Force Substrates.|
|**⊚(R(∆))**|Stabilization Conditions — modulates Ontological Energy and PhaseLocking.|
|**Fₙ**|Stabilized Recursive Constructs — Recursive Mass & Identity as emergent properties.|


## Notes

- **50.0 - Core Concepts** is a **non-recursive layer** — its entities **do not decompose** into lower physical primitives within ∆‑Theory.
    
- These primitives serve as the **generative foundation** for all Recursive Constructs (50.1), Properties & Diagnostics (50.2), and Domain Models (50.3).
    
- Each concept defined here must have **ontological traceability** to PrimitiveDifference and RelationalEmbedding constructs in the Ontology Layer (10).
