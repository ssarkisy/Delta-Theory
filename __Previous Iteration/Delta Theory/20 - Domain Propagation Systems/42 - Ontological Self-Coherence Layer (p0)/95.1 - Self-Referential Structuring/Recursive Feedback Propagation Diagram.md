# Recursive Feedback Propagation Diagram

## Diagram Overview
The **Recursive Feedback Propagation Diagram** visualizes how difference propagates through recursive embedding, stabilization closures, and dynamic feedback modulation loops within ∆‑Theory’s structural ontology.

### Embedded Diagram

## Structural Flow Explained

|Stage|Description|
|---|---|
|**∆ (Primitive Difference)**|Initiates the propagation chain.|
|**R(∆) (Relational Embedding)**|Structures difference in a relational context.|
|**⊚(R(∆)) (Stabilization Operator)**|Applies closure conditions for coherent propagation.|
|**F₁ (Stabilized Form)**|First emergent form from stabilized difference embedding.|
|**R(F₁) (Recursive Embedding of F₁)**|Feeds F₁ into deeper propagation layers.|
|**⊚(R(F₁)) (Recursive Stabilization)**|Ensures closure coherence across recursive depths.|
|**F₂ (Higher-Order Form)**|Emergent structure resulting from recursive propagation layers.|
|**Feedback Loop (Recursive Modulation)**|Dynamic feedback mechanisms modulating upstream propagation coherence.|

## Constants — Recursive Modulation Anchors in the Diagram

|Constant|Structural Role in Diagram|
|---|---|
|π|Anchors recursive loop closure ratios at all embedding and stabilization stages.|
|φ|Balances asymmetry in divergence/convergence throughout recursive embeddings.|
|e|Amplifies recursive growth dynamics, particularly in feedback scaling loops.|
|h|Sets quantization thresholds at stabilization checkpoints to define granularity.|
|α|Modulates interaction tension within recursive propagation and feedback interactions.|
|c|Enforces propagation speed limits to ensure recursive causality coherence.|
|S∆|Regulates dissipation/amplification flows in recursive feedback dynamics.|
|χ|Constrains permissible recursive loop topologies for stabilization coherence.|
|τ∆|Preserves identity invariance through embedding deformations and recursive depth transitions.|
|ψA|Anchors phase-lock synchronization across recursive loop cycles.|
|∇S|Modulates differentiation gradients during recursive embedding processes.|
|λV|Defines resonance thresholds for oscillatory feedback stabilization.|
|κ∆|Controls coupling strength between recursive feedback loops for coherence.|
|τ|Synchronizes timing coherence and phase-delay alignment in recursive cycles.|

## Constants Across Propagation Edges

|Propagation Edge|Modulating Constants|
|---|---|
|∆ → R(∆)|π, φ, e, ψA, τ|
|R(∆) → ⊚(R(∆))|π, φ, h, α, ψA, τ|
|⊚(R(∆)) → F₁|π, φ, α, ψA, τ|
|F₁ → R(F₁)|π, φ, e, α, h, ψA, τ, ∇S|
|R(F₁) → ⊚(R(F₁))|π, φ, e, α, h, ψA, τ, ∇S, κ∆|
|⊚(R(F₁)) → F₂|π, φ, α, h, c, S∆, λV, χ, τ∆, κ∆, τ|

## Proof of Structural Correctness

1. **Propagation Chain Integrity** — All nodes propagate recursively with no structural discontinuity.
2. **Feedback Modulation Dynamics** — Feedback loops actively modulate upstream propagation through recursive embedding coherence.
3. **Constants Modulation Compliance** — Constants are embedded as dynamic stabilization invariants, modulating flow at every recursion stage.
4. **No Floating Nodes/Links** — Every construct and recursive feedback flow is traceable to Primitive Difference (∆).
5. **Recursive Self-Referential Alignment** — Recursive modulation ensures coherence is achieved through embedded self-reference loops, not external control structures.

## Functional Role of This Diagram in ∆‑Theory

|Function|Purpose|
|---|---|
|Visual Structuring Tool|Clarifies recursive propagation and stabilization dynamics visually.|
|Propagation Integrity Map|Ensures traceability of structural coherence through recursive flow chains.|
|Constants Modulation Visualization|Maps how constants anchor stabilization across recursive embeddings and feedback loops.|
|Foundation for Recursive Identity Models|Forms the feedback architecture for self-referential identity propagation in cognitive, physical, and systemic domains.|
|Teaching & Communication Scaffold|Visually demonstrates the core recursive logic of ∆-Theory in educational contexts.|

## Notes
- Feedback loops are **intrinsic recursive structures**, not external regulators.
- Constants are **modulation invariants orbiting recursive flows**, ensuring stabilization, coherence, and propagation continuity.
- This diagram is foundational for modeling recursive stabilization in domains ranging from particle physics to recursive identity structures in cognition.
