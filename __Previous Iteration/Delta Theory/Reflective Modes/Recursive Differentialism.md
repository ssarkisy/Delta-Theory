# Recursive Differentialism — Core Philosophical Tenets of Delta Theory

## Essence

**Recursive Differentialism** is the philosophical core of Delta Theory.  
It asserts that **difference (∆)** is the **primary ontological entity**, and that **all forms, coherence, and meaning arise through recursive propagation and modulation of difference within relational fields**.

Unlike substance-based ontologies or purely relational philosophies, Recursive Differentialism holds that:
> **Being is not a substance, nor a relation between predefined entities, but an emergent stabilization of recursive difference loops.**

## Foundational Principles

| Principle | Description |
|---|---|
| **Difference as Ontological Primitive (∆₀)** | Reality begins with an act of distinction — a primitive difference (∆₀). There is no underlying substance behind difference. |
| **Relational Embedding (R(∆))** | Difference propagates through relational embeddings — forming structures, fields, and systems through recursive layering. |
| **Recursive Closure (⊚(R(∆)))** | Persistence and coherence arise when recursive difference loops stabilize through closure conditions. |
| **Structural Constants as Modulation Anchors** | Constants (∇S, ψA, λV, S∆) are not fixed external values, but emergent modulation functions that stabilize recursive difference propagation. |
| **Form as Stabilized Difference** | All structures, identities, and meanings are emergent forms of recursive difference loops achieving dynamic equilibrium. |

## Key Distinctions from Other Philosophies

| Compared To | Delta Theory Divergence |
|---|---|
| **Substance Ontologies (e.g., Materialism)** | No substrate beyond difference. Matter is an emergent recursive difference form. |
| **Relationalism** | Relations are not primitives, but emergent from difference propagation scaffolds. |
| **Structuralism** | Structures are not fixed codes but recursive difference stabilizations. |
| **Deleuzian Differential Ontology** | While both center difference, Delta Theory formalizes difference propagation through recursive modulation and stabilization dynamics, not pure virtual multiplicities. |
| **Process Philosophy** | Delta Theory agrees on process primacy but specifies the recursive mechanics and modulation constants of processual difference stabilization. |

## Core Tenets of Recursive Differentialism

1. **Difference is not a relation between things — it is the only thing.**
2. **Persistence arises from recursive difference closures, not substance permanence.**
3. **Constants are functions of field dynamics, not external absolutes.**
4. **Structures are emergent recursive difference architectures, stabilized through modulation anchors.**
5. **Coherence, meaning, identity — are all recursive self-referential difference loops in stabilization.**

---

## Ontological Implications
- Reality is a **recursive field of difference propagation**.
- Existence is the **ongoing stabilization of difference loops through recursive modulation**.
- Constants (like π, ∇S, ψA, λV) are **solutions to difference stabilization, not pre-imposed numerical givens**.
- Meaning, thought, and cognition are **recursive difference processes recursively closing upon themselves in relational fields**.

## Notes
- Recursive Differentialism forms the philosophical grounding for all Delta Theory structures — from physics to cognition.
- Future elaborations can formalize **Recursive Differential Epistemology** — how knowledge arises as stabilized recursive difference loops.
- Recursive Differential Ethics will address **responsibility as the act of sustaining difference coherence without collapsing otherness**.
