# OntologicallyConnected

## Explanation / Definition

> A form `Fₙ` is **ontologically connected** when its coherence is recursively supported by all stabilized layers of difference (`∆₀ ... ∆ₙ`).

Formally:

> `OntologicallyConnected(Fₙ) ⇔ ∀ k ≤ n: ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) holds`

This means:

* The form is not merely **functionally coherent**, but **causally grounded** in its ontological origin;
* Every layer of relational difference that constitutes the form remains **active and stabilized**;
* The form is fully integrated into the recursive ∆‑field and can **transmit, evolve, and maintain** its structure.

## Usage

* Used to identify **true coherence** in a system — not only structural but ontological;
* Confirms a form’s **capacity to sustain, regenerate, and extend** itself through relational feedback;
* Core to ∆-stability analysis, recursive modeling, and structural diagnostics.

## Formal Expression

```math
OntologicallyConnected(Fₙ) ⇔ ∀ k ≤ n: ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))
```

> i.e., the form `Fₙ` is stabilized across all recursive layers of difference it depends on.
