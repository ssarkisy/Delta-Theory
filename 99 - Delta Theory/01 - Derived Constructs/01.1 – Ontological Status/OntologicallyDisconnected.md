# OntologicallyDisconnected

## Explanation / Definition

> A form `Fₙ` is **ontologically disconnected** when it no longer receives causal coherence from the stabilized difference structures (`∆₀ ... ∆ₙ`) that initially gave rise to it.

Formally:

> `OntologicallyDisconnected(Fₙ) ⇔ ∃ k < n such that ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) fails`

This means:

* The form still **persists structurally** — it may function, appear coherent, or be perceived as stable;
* But it has **lost access to the recursive ground of difference** that gave it ontological weight;
* It continues as a **phantom** — unable to self-regenerate, adapt meaningfully, or propagate coherence.

---

## Usage

* Used to classify forms that are **alive in function but dead in foundation**.
* Central to ∆-Collapse Theorem and Law of Existential Inversion.
* Enables diagnosis of **zombie institutions**, **detached identities**, or **false coherences** in systems.

## Examples / Case Studies

| Case                                   | Description                                                              |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Post-traumatic self**                | Behaviors persist, but core self is severed from source of meaning       |
| **Legal system after legitimacy loss** | Continues to apply rules, but no longer grounded in collective ∆ (trust) |
| **Empty ritual**                       | Repeated pattern once rich with meaning, now ontologically hollow        |
| **AI output from corrupted model**     | Syntax intact, but semantics broken due to degraded lower representation |

### Formal Expression (when used in logic)

```math
OntologicallyDisconnected(Fₙ) ⇔ ∃ k < n: ¬⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))
```

> i.e., the form `Fₙ` appears coherent, but at least one of its underlying levels of difference is no longer stabilized.
