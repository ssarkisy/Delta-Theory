### Collapse

#### Explanation / Definition

**Collapse** is the event where a stabilized form `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` fails due to excess ∆‑tension.

> Collapse occurs when  
> ∃ j ≤ n such that `∆‑Tension(∆ⱼ) > CollapseThreshold(∆ⱼ)`

This results in loss of coherence at one or more levels of recursion.

---

#### Mechanism

Collapse is triggered when the **structural strain** in maintaining a distinction exceeds what the system can stabilize.

---

#### Dependencies

- [[∆‑Tension]] — the pressure of maintained difference
- [[CollapseThreshold]] — the tolerance limit for tension
- [[Resilience(Fₙ)]] — the overall buffer against collapse

---

#### Effects

- The form becomes a [[CollapsedForms|CollapsedForm]]
- May lead to rise in [[Entropy]] and loss of memory/structure
- Recovery requires explicit [[RestorationChain]] across damaged levels

#### Examples

| Domain         | Collapse Scenario                                   |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Consciousness  | Breakdown of ego boundary due to traumatic overload |
| Software       | Memory leak crashes service despite top-level logs  |
| Institutions   | Collapse of legitimacy → loss of coordination       |

---

#### Summary

**Collapse is the ontological failure of difference** under unsustainable pressure.  
It marks the **end of stabilization** — and the beginning of disorder.
