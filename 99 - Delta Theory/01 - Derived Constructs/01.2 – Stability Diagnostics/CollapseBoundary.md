# CollapseBoundary

## Explanation / Definition

A **CollapseBoundary** is a **critical relational surface** in ∆‑space where recursive stabilization (`⊚(Rⁿ(∆))`) begins to fail. It marks the **limit of coherence** for a given form `Fₙ`, beyond which **collapse**, **dissipation**, or **restoration** is triggered.

Unlike classical physical surfaces, this is not a boundary in space — but in **stabilization conditions**: the **∆‑gradient, curvature, or tension** exceeds a form’s holding capacity.

> CollapseBoundary is **not an edge**, but a **threshold in recursion depth, ∆‑tension, or curvature**, where form integrity decays.

---

## Formal Schema

Let:

- `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a stabilized recursive form
- `⊚(Rⁿ(∆))` be its stabilization function
- `∂⊚ / ∂x` be the local gradient of stabilization in direction `x`

Then:

> A **CollapseBoundary** occurs at points where  
> `∂⊚ / ∂x ≥ CollapseThreshold(Fₙ)`

In this regime, form begins to:
- lose coherence (`stability(Rⁿ)` drops),
- release stored ∆ as energy or radiation,
- deform into lower-order or pseudo‑forms.

## Interpretive Notes

- **Force**, in this model, often arises as the **gradient pressure around CollapseBoundaries** — not from particles, but from **topological instability**.

- Boundaries can be:
  - **Internal** (within a loop, like black hole horizons)
  - **Environmental** (shift in external ∆‑field)
  - **Relational** (entanglement collapse, decoherence)

- CollapseBoundary helps define **when** something **transforms** vs. persists.

## Usage in ∆‑Theory

- Serves as **substrate of impulse / force**:
  When a stabilized form enters collapse conditions, the emitted ∆‑flow behaves like classical momentum.

- Explains **radiant energy release**:
  As form crosses boundary, difference is released as ∆‑flux (`RadiantEnergy`).

- Connects to:
  - `ResonanceChain` destabilization
  - `Collapse(Fₙ)` initiation
  - `restore(∆ⱼ)` (energy of disintegration)
