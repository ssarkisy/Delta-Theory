# CollapseThreshold

## Explanation / Definition

**CollapseThreshold** is the minimal amount of ∆‑tension that must be exceeded to destabilize a form `Fₙ`.

It defines the **limit of sustainable differentiation** — the point beyond which a recursive structure of differences can no longer be maintained.

---

## Formal Condition

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` be a stabilized form.

Then:

> `Collapse occurs ⇔ ∆-Tension(Fₙ) > CollapseThreshold(Fₙ)`

That is:
A form collapses when the tension across its difference structure exceeds its internal threshold of resilience.

---

## Dependencies

- [[∆‑Tension]]: Quantified stress or strain within the recursive difference system.
- [[Depth(Fₙ)]]: Higher depth generally lowers the collapse threshold.
- [[StructuralInertia]]: Delays collapse but does not raise the threshold itself.

---

## Related Concepts

- [[Collapse(Fₙ)]]: Event caused by exceeding this threshold.
- [[StructuralInertia]]: May create apparent delay before collapse.
- [[RestorationChain]]: Cannot be initiated unless collapse is recognized.
- [[Resilience(Fₙ)]]: Potential inverse function of CollapseThreshold.

## Usage

- In physics: describes **material failure** or quantum decoherence.
- In cognition: models **breakdown of identity** or working memory overload.
- In society: critical points of **institutional failure** or **loss of trust**.
- In systems: models **error propagation**, crashes, or memory corruption.

## Expression in ∆-Notation

Let:

> `τ(Fₙ)` = ∆-Tension of form `Fₙ`

> `θ(Fₙ)` = CollapseThreshold of form `Fₙ`

Then collapse is defined by:

> `τ(Fₙ) > θ(Fₙ) ⇒ Fₙ ∈ [[CollapsedForms]]`
