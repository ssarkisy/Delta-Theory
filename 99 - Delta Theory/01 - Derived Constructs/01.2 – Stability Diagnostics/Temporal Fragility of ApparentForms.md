# Temporal Fragility of [[ApparentForms]]

## Explanation / Definition

Apparent forms are **temporally unstable**. Even if coherent in the moment, they will eventually collapse if the underlying ∆ is not re-stabilized.

> **Formal statement**:
> ∀ F ∈ ApparentForms: `limₜ→∞ Prob(¬F) → 1`

## Usage

* Predicts failure in delayed-collapse systems.
* Tool for evaluating risk in fragile architectures (political, computational, cognitive).

## Examples / Case Studies

* Economic bubbles.
* Repressive governments post-collapse of shared meaning.
* Dissociative coping strategies that fail under stress.
