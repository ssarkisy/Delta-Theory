# RestorationChain

## Definition

The **Restoration Chain** is a **recursive sequence of operations** required to **rebuild stability** in a collapsed ∆‑based system, progressing **from a destabilized level `k` up to level `n`**.

Each restoration of a difference `∆ⱼ` allows the corresponding form `Fⱼ` to be stabilized.

---

## Formal Expression

> **∀ j ∈ \[k, n]:** `restore(∆ⱼ) ⇒ stabilize(Fⱼ)`

This expresses the **necessary condition** for recovering a coherent structure: each layer of difference must be **individually restored** before its form can be stabilized.

---

## Role in Theory

* Models **bottom-up reassembly** after collapse or trauma
* Dual to the **top-down destabilization cascade** described in the ∆‑Collapse Theorem
* Encodes the **asymmetry between collapse and recovery**

---

## Interpretation

* **Collapse is fast and cascading** — a top-down chain of destabilizations
* **Restoration is slow and recursive** — each level must be **repaired one-by-one**
* **No higher form can be truly stable** unless its **base differences have been restored**

---

## Usage in Theory

* **Corollary 5: Principle of Asymmetric Restoration**
* Recovery modeling after:

  * Cognitive trauma
  * Systemic breakdown
  * Institutional collapse
* Can be extended to **repair protocols** for AI, logic, or governance
