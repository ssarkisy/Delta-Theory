# Depth(Fₙ)

## Explanation / Definition

**Depth(Fₙ)** is the number of recursive relational layers `Rⁿ(∆₀)` involved in the stabilization of a form `Fₙ`.

It quantifies the **ontological depth** of a form — the extent to which its structure depends on **nested differences** that must each be stabilized in order to maintain coherence.

> Formally:  
> If `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`, then  `Depth(Fₙ) = n`

---

## Primitive Status

- **Irreducible** structural attribute of any ∆-form.
- Cannot be derived from surface behavior; must be inferred from construction path.
- Reflects **how far a form is removed** from the base difference ∆₀.

---

## Role in ∆-Theory

- **Essential for quantifying**:
  - [[PotentialEnergy]]: deeper forms store more ∆-tension
  - [[StructuralInertia]]: resistance grows with depth
  - [[RestorationChain]]: recovery requires traversing all levels of depth

- Differentiates **shallow forms** (volatile, reactive) from **deep forms** (stable, inertial).

---

## Dependencies

- Requires a well-defined recursive structure:  
  `Fₙ = ⊚(R(R(...(R(∆₀)))))` with *n* layers.
- Assumes stabilization (`⊚`) at each level.

---

## Related Concepts

- [[PotentialEnergy]]: Scales with `Depth(Fₙ)` and ∆-tension at each level.
- [[∆‑Tension]]: Held recursively across depth.
- [[RestorationChain]]: Traverses levels from `k` to `n`.
- [[CollapsedForms]]: Have failed at some level ≤ `n`.

---

## Usage

- Acts as a **proxy for internal complexity** or **semantic thickness**.
- Informs design of robust systems (deep = more resilient, but harder to restore).
- Explains **why deeper trauma** is harder to heal, or **why deep beliefs** resist change.

## Examples / Case Studies

| Domain        | Depth(Fₙ) Represents                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Physics       | Nested field interactions → stable matter forms |
| Cognition     | Deep schema or identity structures               |
| Systems       | Multi-layered architecture (e.g. OS stack)       |
| Language      | Sentence with nested subordinate clauses         |
| Memory        | Associative links across multiple abstraction layers |

## Expression in ∆-notation

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`.  
Then:

> `Depth(Fₙ) = n`  
> That is:  
> The **ontological complexity** of a form equals the number of **stabilized recursive differences** it holds.
