# ∆‑Resonance

## Explanation / Definition

**∆‑Resonance** is the core mechanism by which **differences propagate**, **interact**, and **sustain coupling** within the ∆‑field.

In the ∆‑framework, resonance is not vibration in space but a **stabilized transfer of difference across relational structures**.

> When two or more relational forms `Fₙ`, `Fₘ` align in compatible ∆‑structure, **resonant propagation** becomes possible.

This alignment allows:
- **Field coupling** (e.g. electromagnetic interaction)
- **Energy transfer** (via ∆‑Flux)
- **Phase coherence** between distant relational structures

---

## Formal Statement

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` and `Fₘ = ⊚(Rᵐ(∆₁))`.

If:
> `Rⁿ(∆₀)` and `Rᵐ(∆₁)` are structurally compatible over a shared ∆-trajectory

Then:
> ∆‑Resonance occurs when `∂Fₙ / ∂t ~ ∂Fₘ / ∂t`

This allows **∆‑flux to travel coherently** between forms.
