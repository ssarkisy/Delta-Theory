# Foundational Properties of Difference (∆)

### 1. **Non-Identity Principle**

**∆ ≠ ∆** Difference **is not self-identical**. Any ∆ implies a relation _between_ — not a unit _of_. → This prevents ∆ from becoming a "thing" — it remains pure potential for differentiation.

---

### 2. **Relational Dependency**

**∆ can only manifest via R** A bare ∆ is not observable, stable, or form-generating. Only `R(∆)` enables it to be interpreted or embedded.

> ∆ is ontologically prior, but functionally inert without relation.

---

### 3. **Contextual Polarity**

Every ∆ implies **a contrast space**, even if minimal: → ∆ always exists _between at least two relational states_, e.g., {A, ¬A}.

We can denote this schematically:

```text
∆ ≡ (a ≠ b) in context C
```

But a and b are **not substances** — only distinguishable poles within R.

---

### 4. **No Substance Guarantee**

∆ does **not guarantee objecthood**. A difference may not resolve into a persistent or looped form. This reflects **instability as default**.

---

### 5. **∆-Propagation**

Differences can **trigger further differences** via their embedding:

```text
∆₀ → R(∆₀) → ∆₁ → R(∆₁) → ...
```

This creates a **∆-chain**, basis for recursion and emergence.

---

### 6. **∆-Anisotropy** _(proposed)_

∆ is **directional** — some differences propagate (∆↑), others dissipate (∆↓). This opens space for later modeling of ∆-flow, ∆-tension, and entropy-like behavior.

---

### 7. **∆-Singularity Potential**

Some ∆ are **singular attractors** — they cause **recursive reinforcement** when embedded:

```text
R(∆₀) → ∆₁ = ∆₀ → R(∆₁) = R(∆₀) → ...
```

This is the **minimal case of self-looping**.
