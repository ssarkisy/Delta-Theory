# Superposition

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, **Superposition** refers to the **co-presence of multiple potential ∆‑structures** within a relational field before stabilization.

> Superposition := `Σᵢ R(∆ᵢ)`
> where no single `⊚(R(∆ᵢ))` has yet been selected

It is a **meta-stable configuration** in which **several difference-patterns** exist in **parallel**, awaiting collapse into a stabilized form.

## Formal Characteristics

| Property          | Description                                             |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Non-exclusive** | Multiple `R(∆ᵢ)` coexist without mutual cancellation    |
| **Unstabilized**  | No `⊚` has acted → system remains open to resolution    |
| **Interferent**   | ∆‑patterns can constructively or destructively interact |
| **Probabilistic** | Collapse yields one stabilized form among potentials    |

## Relation to Other Concepts

* [[Collapse]]: Process by which one ∆‑structure is stabilized
* [[PotentialEnergy]]: Stored ∆‑tension among unresolved forms
* [[Wavefunction]]: A mapping of possible R(∆) before ⊚-selection
* [[QuantumMeasurement]]: Trigger of stabilization
* [[∆‑Field]]: Domain in which superposed forms propagate/interfere

---

## Interpretation

Superposition is **not contradiction**, but **structured ambiguity**:

> The system "holds" difference as potential,
> not yet resolved into a single path of relation.

In ∆-terms:

> A region where **difference is overdetermined but not yet realized.**

## Applications

| Domain          | Superposition Represents                    |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Quantum physics | Coexistence of multiple quantum states      |
| Decision theory | Parallel intentions or futures              |
| Language        | Polysemy or unresolved meaning              |
| Perception      | Ambiguous figures (e.g., Necker cube)       |
| Cognition       | Holding multiple interpretations in thought |

## Expression in ∆-notation

Let:

* `∆ᵢ` be distinguishable inputs
* `R(∆ᵢ)` be possible relation embeddings

Then:

> Superposition = `{R(∆₁), R(∆₂), ..., R(∆ₖ)}`
> ⊚(Superposition) → one stabilized form `Fⱼ`

## Placement Recommendation

**Primary Folder:**

* `50 - Physics / 03 - Fields and Forces` (under quantum conceptual layer)

**Symlinks in:**

* `50 - Physics / 01 - Energy` → tied to unresolved `[[PotentialEnergy]]`
* `50 - Physics / 04 - Particles and Mass` → applicable to quantum particles
* `30 - ∆-Mathematics / 03 - Logical Operators` → for modeling overlapping structures
* `70 - Cognition / 02 - Perception and Ambiguity` → for interpretive superposition
