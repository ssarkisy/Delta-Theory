# QuantumMeasurement

## Explanation / Definition

**Quantum Measurement** is the process by which a **superposed or entangled ∆‑structure becomes locally stabilized** through interaction with an observer or environment.

In ∆‑theory, this is not an arbitrary collapse, but a **transition from multistable ∆‑resonance to a single stabilized `Fₙ` form**, selected by environmental constraints or contextual ∆‑bias.

---

## Formal Statement

Let a form exist in superposition:

> `Ψ = Σ cᵢ · Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)`  
> where multiple `∆ᵢ` are **co‑resonant**

A measurement `M` enforces:

> `⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))` for **exactly one** `∆ᵢ`

This selects a single stable form `Fₙ` and destroys coherence with other branches.

| Classical QM              | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                               |
|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Collapse of wavefunction  | Stabilization of one ∆ in a multistable configuration  |
| Irreversible observation  | Loss of ∆‑resonance with alternatives                 |
| Measurement problem       | Mode transition from `∆-cloud` to `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)`        |

## Requirements

- System in superposition or entangled state
- External ∆‑perturbation or resonance bias
- Selection of 1 ∆₀ → stabilization: `Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`

## Related Concepts

- [[Superposition]]: Initial multistable configuration before measurement
- [[Entanglement]]: Co-resonant configurations severed upon measurement
- [[CollapseThreshold]]: Threshold beyond which ∆‑instability resolves into a form
- [[Observer]]: A form that interacts and co‑modulates stabilization (can be extended)

## Usage

- Formalizes **measurement-induced collapse** in a relational ontology
- Provides grounding for **decoherence, contextual emergence**, and **irreversibility**
- Applicable to cognitive, physical, and computational systems
