# Dark Matter

## Explanation / Definition

**Dark Matter** in FRONT is interpreted not as a new particle, but as **massive forms whose ∆‑structure is not coherently embedded in the observer's R‑field**.

> `Fₙ ∈ DarkMatter ⇔ ∃ mass(Fₙ) ∧ Rₒ(Fₙ) = ∅`

That is:
A form has **relational mass** (recursive stabilization and loop), but its structure is either:

* **Not present in the local field of relations** (`Rₒ`)
* Or **not in resonance** with our current observational ∆-embedding

---

## Key Characteristics

| Property    | FRONT Interpretation                         |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Mass        | Present via recursive loop `Rⁿ(∆)`           |
| Visibility  | Absent — no resonance with local R           |
| Interaction | Gravitational only — deforms shared R‑fields |
| Detection   | Only via **∆-curvature** in relational space |

---

## Formal Statement

Let:

* `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a stabilized, looped form (i.e. has mass)
* `Rₒ` be the observer's field of relations

Then:

> `Fₙ ∈ DarkMatter ⇔ loop(Fₙ) ∧ Rₒ(Fₙ) = ∅`

Where:

* `loop(Fₙ)` indicates recursive closure
* `Rₒ(Fₙ)` measures relational embedding into observer’s field

---

## Implications

* Dark matter ≠ hidden object → it's **difference outside observed resonance**
* Explains:

  * Lack of electromagnetic interaction
  * Purely gravitational effects
  * Stability of galaxies without visible mass

---

## Usage in ∆‑Physics

* Serves as boundary case for `Matter` without observable `Form`
* Suggests new methods of detection: **∆-resonance mapping** instead of direct measurement
* Raises open questions:

  * Can R be extended to include hidden ∆?
  * Are pseudo-forms ever mistaken for dark matter?
