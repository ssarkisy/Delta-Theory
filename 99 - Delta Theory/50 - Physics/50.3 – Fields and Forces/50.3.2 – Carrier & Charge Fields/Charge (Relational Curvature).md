# Charge (Relational Curvature)

## Explanation / Definition

In FRONT, **charge** is interpreted not as an intrinsic substance, but as a property emerging from **asymmetry in the relational field**:

> **Charge := curvature or twist in the stabilized ∆‑loop**  
> `Charge(Fₙ) ∝ Curvature(Rⁿ(∆₀))`

This curvature creates directional ∆‑flows and field-like behavior.

## Ontological Framing

- In contrast to classical physics (where charge is a fundamental quantity),
  here it emerges from **geometric or topological asymmetry** in the way ∆ is held.
- Positive and negative charges correspond to **opposite orientations** or **twists** in the relational loop.

## Properties

| Property     | ∆-Theory Interpretation                                   |
|--------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Polarity     | Direction of curvature in the ∆‑loop                     |
| Field        | Emerges as ∆‑flux emanating from curved structure        |
| Interaction  | Attraction/repulsion = ∆-field resonance of opposite/same curvatures |
| Conservation | Stability of internal ∆-loop geometry                    |
