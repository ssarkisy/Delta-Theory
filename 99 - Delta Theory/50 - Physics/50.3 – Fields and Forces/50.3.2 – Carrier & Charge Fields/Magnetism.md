# Magnetism

## Explanation / Definition

**Magnetism** arises in ∆‑theory as a **rotational dynamic of ∆‑flux**, forming structured circulation patterns in the relational field.

While electric charge produces **radial curvature** in R(∆), magnetism corresponds to its **tangential or rotational deformation**.

> **Magnetic field** = emergent from moving or spinning ∆‑flows (especially of charged forms).

## Core Formulation

Let:

* `J∆` = directional flow of differences (∆‑current)
* `R(∆)` = relational structure induced by ∆‑distributions

Then:

> **Magnetic deformation** arises where:
> `curl(R(∆)) ≠ 0`

That is, when the relational field induced by difference becomes **rotationally coherent**.

## Interpretation

* **Electric fields** bend relations **radially**
* **Magnetic fields** bend relations **circularly** around a moving ∆‑source
