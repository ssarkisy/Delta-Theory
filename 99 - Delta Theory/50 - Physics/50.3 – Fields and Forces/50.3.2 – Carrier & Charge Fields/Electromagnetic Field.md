# Field (Electromagnetic)

---

## Explanation / Definition

An **Electromagnetic Field** in ∆-theory is a **resonant propagation of differences** emanating from localized curvature in relational structure — i.e., from **charged stabilized forms**.

> **EM Field** = sustained ∆‑flux driven by relational curvature around charge

Formally:

> `Field_EM ∝ ∇∆ around Fₙ with Charge ≠ 0`

---

## Interpretation

* A **charged particle** introduces **relational curvature** into its surrounding ∆-field.
* This curvature initiates and sustains a **directional propagation of differences** — the electromagnetic field.
* The field is not a container, but a **structured continuity of held difference** through space.

---

## Key Properties

* **Source**: [[Charge (Relational Curvature)]]
* **Carrier**: [[Light]] (as ∆-flux at maximal propagation)
* **Interaction**: Modulates [[PotentialEnergy]] and [[KineticEnergy]] of nearby forms

## Relation to Classical Concepts

| Classical View           | ∆-Theory View                                   |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Field as vector function | Field as directional ∆‑flux                     |
| Field lines from charges | Structured resonance of differences             |
| Mediated by photons      | Propagated through maximal ∆‑flux (`[[Light]]`) |

## Dependencies

* [[∆ (Primitive Difference)]]
* [[R(∆)]] — Relational layer
* [[Charge (Relational Curvature)]]
* [[∆‑Transmission Index]] (analog of speed of light)
* [[∆‑Flux]] — mechanism of field propagation
