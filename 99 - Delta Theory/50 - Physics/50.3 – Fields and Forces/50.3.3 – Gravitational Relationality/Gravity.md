# Gravity

## Explanation / Definition

In FRONT / ∆‑theory, **gravity** is understood not as curvature of spacetime, but as **deformation of the relational field** caused by deeply stabilized difference structures.

> `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` with high `Depth(Fₙ)` produces localized distortion in `R`.

That is:

> **Gravitational force arises when** `R′(∆) ≠ R(∆)` — the relations themselves are warped by the presence of mass.

---

## Formal Approximation

Let:

* `R(∆)` be the default (flat) relational embedding
* `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a massive form

Then:

> `∇R ≠ 0`
> or
> `δR / δ∆ ≠ 0`

indicates **relational curvature** — a gravitational field in ∆‑space.
