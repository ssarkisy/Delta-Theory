# Black Hole

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, a **Black Hole** is a stabilized recursive form `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` with **extreme depth**, **loop closure**, and **relational deformation** so intense that **no propagating difference (∆‑flux)** can escape its boundary.

> A black hole is a region of recursive ∆‑compression where **all outward paths of differentiation collapse** inward.

The form’s **Depth(Fₙ) → ∞** and **Structural Inertia** leads to:

- Maximum local **relational curvature** (∇R → ∞)
- ∆-propagation **threshold collapse**
- Enforced inward stability (singularity-like condition)

## Key Properties

| Feature             | ∆-Theory View                                  |
|---------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| Event Horizon       | ∆-flux boundary where `∂Fₙ/∂t → 0`            |
| Singularity         | Infinite `Depth(Fₙ)` / non-resolvable loop    |
| Gravitational pull  | Extreme deformation of `R(∆)`                  |
| No escape           | All ∆-paths converge inward (collapse zone)    |
| Time dilation       | ∆-stabilization occurs with near-zero unfolding|

## Formal Indicators

Let `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` and `loop(Fₙ)` be the closed recursive configuration.

Black hole occurs when:

> - `Depth(Fₙ) ≫ 1`  
> - `loop(Fₙ) → singular closure`  
> - `∇R ≫ threshold`  
> - `CollapseThreshold(Fₙ) exceeded for outbound ∆`

## Interpretation

* A black hole is not an object, but a **relational limit structure**, where further difference **cannot be externally stabilized**.
* From outside, it's perceived as **∆-invisibility** — information cannot re‑emerge.
