### ∆‑Transmission Index (`c₍∆₎`)

#### Explanation / Definition

The **∆‑Transmission Index** `c₍∆₎` defines the **maximum speed at which stabilized differences (∆)** can propagate through the relational field `R`. It serves as a fundamental **ontological limit** in ∆‑theory, analogous to the speed of light `c` in classical physics, but derived from **relational recursion and stabilization logic**, not spacetime.

> `c₍∆₎` = **upper bound on difference transmission** through a ∆‑field It expresses the fastest sustainable rate at which one stable configuration of difference can generate the next.

---

#### Formal Approximation

Let a sequence of stabilized differences evolve through recursive embeddings:

```
∆₀ —R→ ∆₁ —R→ ∆₂ —R→ ...
```

If `t(∆ⱼ → ∆ⱼ₊₁)` is the time it takes for `∆ⱼ` to generate `∆ⱼ₊₁` through `R`, then:

> **`c₍∆₎ = min(t⁻¹)`** over all stable propagation paths

This defines a **transmission horizon** — a speed ceiling emergent from the recursion structure of `R`, not from spacetime mechanics.

---

#### Interpretive Notes

- `c₍∆₎` measures not physical motion, but **ontological transmission**: the steepest rate at which difference can become new form without destabilizing.
    
- In this view, **photonic or open-loop forms** propagate _at_ `c₍∆₎`, while **massive forms** (requiring recursive stabilization) propagate **slower**.
    
- It introduces a natural **∆-causality** structure: what can influence what, and how fast.

#### Usage

- Anchors causal boundaries in ∆-field dynamics (i.e., what can affect what within a ∆‑domain).
    
- Sets upper frequency for `restore(∆)` in energy calculations.
    
- Grounds the time scale in ∆‑based field calculus.
    
- Replaces `c` in derived relations, such as:
    

```
E = inertia × c₍∆₎²
```

Where _inertia_ is derived from recursive depth or structural resistance, not mass per se.
