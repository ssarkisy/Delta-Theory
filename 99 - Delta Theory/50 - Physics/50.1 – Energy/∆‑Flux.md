# ∆‑Flux

## Explanation / Definition

**∆‑Flux** is the **continuous flow or transformation** of differences across relational configurations.

In ∆‑theory, change is not the motion of particles but the **transmission of structured difference** (`∆`) through the field `R`.

> `∆‑Flux` describes the **rate and directionality** of this transmission.
> It is the ontological basis for **kinetic**, **radiant**, and even **cognitive energy**.

## Formal Approximation

Let a form `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` unfold through time, generating transitions `∆ⱼ → ∆ⱼ₊₁`.

Define:

> `∆‑Flux(Fₙ) ∝ ∂∆ / ∂t`
> — the **temporal gradient of difference propagation**.

This is analogous to electric or heat flux, but defined in ∆-space.

## Key Properties

| Property              | Description                                       |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| **Directionality**    | Oriented along ∆-gradients across the field `R`   |
| **Intensity**         | Related to depth and coherence of ∆‑waves         |
| **Propagation limit** | Capped by [[∆‑Transmission Index]] (analog of c) |
| **Carrier forms**     | E.g. `[[Photon]] = pure ∆‑flux with no mass`      |

## Usage

* Describes **energy transfer** in the field — like heat, light, momentum.
* Kinetic energy is a **subset** of ∆‑Flux, when form `Fₙ` itself moves.
* Radiant energy is **pure** ∆‑Flux (photon-like, open-ended).
* Neural or cognitive signal = localized ∆‑Flux in relational field of mind.
