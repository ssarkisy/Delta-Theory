# Field (∆‑Relational)

## Explanation / Definition

In **FRONT**, a **field** is not a background of scalar or vector values, but a **region of stabilized and propagating difference** (`∆`) within a **fractal relational structure** (`R`).

> **Field = stable region of ∆‑structures in a recursive relational embedding**

This generalizes all classical fields (e.g. electromagnetic, gravitational) as *patterns of coherence and transmission of ∆ across space*.

---

## Formal Interpretation

Let:

* `∆ᵢ` be a primitive difference
* `Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)` its recursive relational embedding
* `⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))` its stabilized form

Then a **field** is the set:

> `Field = { ⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)) | ∀ i ∈ domain, ∆ᵢ ≈ coherent }`

That is:
A field is a **coherent distribution of stabilized ∆-structures**, where coherence can be local, global, or layered.

| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Field         | Region supporting stable ∆ structures                                   |
| Interaction   | Transfer / resonance of difference across embedded layers               |
| Source / Sink | Zones of concentrated or dissipating ∆                                  |
| Strength      | Magnitude of recursively stabilized difference in a local configuration |
| Curvature     | Deformation of relational embedding due to mass or energy               |

## Examples

| Classical Field     | FRONT Equivalent                                 |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Electromagnetic** | Wave-propagating ∆ in dual R channels            |
| **Gravitational**   | Curved R due to ∆‑density of embedded mass forms |
| **Scalar field**    | Uniform layer of identical ∆‑structure           |
| **Spin field**      | Orientation-based differences in nested ∆‑forms  |

## Related Concepts

* [[∆ (Primitive Difference)]]: Foundation of all field activity
* [[R(∆)]]: Embedding of difference into relational structure
* [[⊚ — Stabilization Operator]]: Stabilization condition that defines local coherence
* [[Gravity]]: Interprets gravity as distortion in the field
* [[∆‑Resonance]]: Mechanism of field propagation and coupling

---

## Usage

* Models **fields** as **ontological distributions of coherence**, not mere number maps.
* Unifies **physical interaction, communication, and perception** as processes of ∆ transmission.
* Offers **multi-layered perspective**: classical fields emerge as projections of deeper recursive ∆ patterns.

## Notes

* In this model, **"field strength"** = amount and depth of stabilized ∆
* **Field curvature** = deviation from uniform R(∆) topology
* Enables reinterpretation of **wave-particle duality**, **quantum fields**, and **spacetime** under a single framework of **∆‑stabilization in R**
