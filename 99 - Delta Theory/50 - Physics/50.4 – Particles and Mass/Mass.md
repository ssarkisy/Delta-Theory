# Mass

## Explanation / Definition

**Mass** in the FRONT framework is not a substance or intrinsic property, but a **measure of recursive resistance** to transformation. It emerges when a difference `∆` is not just embedded and stabilized, but **recursively looped back into itself** through layered relations.

> Mass arises from the **depth** and **closedness** of a stabilized form:
>
> `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` such that `Fₙ ⊚→ ∆₀`

This looping structure creates **inertia** — the form resists dissolution and remains persistent in the ∆-field.

---

## Formal Hypothesis

Mass is proportional to:

- `depth(Rⁿ)`: how many relational layers the stabilized form contains
- `coherence(loop(Fₙ))`: how fully and symmetrically the form returns into its generative difference

> **mass(Fₙ) ∝ depth(Fₙ) × coherence(loop(Fₙ))**

---

## Ontological Role

- Mass is the **resistance to reconfiguration**: the deeper and more looped a form is, the harder it is to change.
- Mass is not tied to substance, but to **self-reinforcing difference**.
- It grounds inertia, persistence, and gravitation.

## Relation to [[Matter]]

Mass is a **quantitative expression** of a **qualitative structure**:

> [[Matter]] is any looped form.  
> `Mass` is **how strongly** it loops and resists change.

## Dependencies

- [[Depth(Fₙ)]]: recursive layering of stabilized relations
- [[∆‑Tension]]: internal holding force within loop
- [[Loop(Fₙ)]]: topological closure in ∆-space

## Related Concepts

- [[KineticEnergy]]: change of form over time
- [[PotentialEnergy]]: tension held in stable configuration
- [[CollapseThreshold]]: limit of sustainable ∆-tension

---

## Usage

- Explains why some forms persist while others dissipate
- Foundation for reconceptualizing **mass-energy equivalence**
- Can model black holes, particle confinement, and matter states

## Examples / Case Studies

| System             | Mass Interpretation                                       |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Photon             | No mass: open form, ∆ propagates without closure          |
| Electron           | Unit mass: minimal looped form with full resonance        |
| Neutron Star       | Extremely high mass: deep nested stability, dense loops   |
| Gluon (confined)   | Cannot be isolated: partial loop, mass arises only in group |
| Black Hole         | Maximal mass: ∆ loops trapped beyond collapse threshold   |
