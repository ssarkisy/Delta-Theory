# Gluon

## Explanation / Definition

In the ∆‑framework, a **Gluon** is not a particle in the traditional sense, but a **transient mediator of ∆‑resonance** that operates **within composite recursive forms** like protons and neutrons.

It serves as the **relational glue** between **non‑free ∆‑fragments** (quarks), enabling them to remain co‑stable inside a higher‑order ∆‑loop.

---

## Formal Schema

Let:

- `Fᵢ = Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)` and `Fⱼ = Rⁿ(∆ⱼ)` be partial recursive sub‑loops (quarks)
    
- `Gluon` = transient structure `G` such that:
    

> `⊚(R(Fᵢ + G + Fⱼ))` → holds composite coherence

Then:

> `G = ∆‑resonant coupling between sub‑forms`

Where:

- `G` is **not independent**: it vanishes outside the coupled structure
    
- It **mediates curvature**, not mass — no standalone inertia
    
- Exists only within the **nested recursive space** of a composite particle

## Core Properties

|Property|∆‑Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Carrier of force|Resonance of difference between recursive paths|
|Localized|Exists only within bound ∆‑systems (e.g. hadrons)|
|No free state|Cannot stabilize independently in ∆‑field|
|Relational entity|A coupling vector, not a stable form|
|Oscillatory|Appears as recursive ∆‑flux maintaining quark coherence|

---

## Interpretation

- Gluons are **∆‑stabilizers** that **distribute and modulate difference** across quark paths
    
- They act as **intermediate difference currents** within a recursive field
    
- Their inability to exist freely reflects their **purely relational** (not form-based) identity
    

---

## Usage

- Models **strong interaction** as internal coherence among sub‑loops
    
- Explains **quark confinement** through the impossibility of free gluons
    
- Provides template for other ∆‑mediators like synaptic signals or cultural memes (structural analogy)
