# Weak Interaction

## Explanation / Definition

In the ∆‑framework, **Weak Interaction** is interpreted as a **∆‑topological transformation** that enables a stabilized form `Fₙ` to **reconfigure its internal ∆‑loops**, resulting in a shift of identity and emergence of new forms.

Unlike strong or electromagnetic interactions, it **does not preserve the original loop configuration**, but **dissolves or restructures internal bindings** — often releasing residual difference into the surrounding field.

> `WeakInteraction(Fₙ) → Fₙ′ + Fₓ + ∆ₑ`
>
> where `Fₙ′` is a restructured form, `Fₓ` is an emergent byproduct, and `∆ₑ` is released excess difference (e.g. in the form of neutrinos).

## Core Features

| Property             | ∆-Interpretation                                                 |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transformation       | Internal relooping or collapse of part of the recursive form     |
| Non-conserving       | Original `Loop(Fₙ)` is **not preserved**, unlike in EM or strong |
| Generates difference | Produces `∆`-radiation (e.g. neutrinos) as escape of tension     |
| Context-sensitive    | Triggered by **loss of stabilizing relational context**          |

## Example: Neutron Decay

Neutron (`Fₙ`) decays into:

* Proton (`Fₙ′`)
* Electron (`Fₓ`)
* Antineutrino (`∆ₑ`)

Represented as:

> `WeakInteraction(Fₙ) → Proton + Electron + Antineutrino`

## Formal Schema

Let:

* `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a stabilized composite form
* `Loop(Fₙ)` = recursive containment of ∆
* Environment loses resonance: `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` destabilizes

Then:

* Weak interaction initiates partial collapse or topological relooping:

  * `CollapsePath(Fₙ)` opens new ∆‑trajectories
  * Forms split and new structures emerge

## Dependencies

* [[Fₙ (Form as Rⁿ(∆₀))]]
* [[CollapseThreshold]]
* [[∆‑Tension]]
* [[Loop(Fₙ)]]
* [[Neutron]]
* [[Neutrino]]
* [[StructuralInertia]]

## Usage

* Explains **decay** and **transmutation** of massive particles
* Models **non-conserved transformation** in ∆-based particle systems
* Foundation for understanding **asymmetry** and **irreversibility** in form interactions

| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Neutron decay        | ∆‑loop opens → reconfigured `Fₙ′`, released tension as ∆‑flux   |
| Beta decay           | Emission of new form by relooping of an inner sub‑structure     |
| Conscious transition | Sudden reconfiguration of identity when inner difference shifts |
