# Matter

## Explanation / Definition

In the FRONT framework, **matter** is defined not by substance, but by **structural persistence** through recursive stabilization of difference.

> A system becomes **matter** when its ∆-structure forms a **closed or resonantly self-sustaining loop**:
>
> `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` and `Fₙ ⊚→ ∆₀`

That is, the form not only arises from difference — it **feeds back into** its own source of coherence. Matter is the **ontological loop** that holds itself.

---

## Structural Criteria

A form `Fₙ` qualifies as matter if:

1. It is **recursively stabilized**: `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)`
2. It has **looped closure**: the structure returns into its generative difference: `Fₙ → ∆₀`
3. It maintains **internal resonance**: stability is preserved by mutual reinforcement of nested ∆-layers.

---

## Ontological Role

- Matter is the **domain of persistence** in the ∆-field.
- Where [[Photon]] runs openly as a ∆-wave, **matter retains** and contains.
- Matter marks the **threshold from propagation to containment** of difference.

---

## Relation to [[Mass]]

- [[Mass]] quantifies how much a matter-form **resists transformation**.
- Matter is the **qualitative form**; mass is its **quantified recursion**.
- All matter has mass; not all forms have either.

## Dependencies

- [[∆ (Primitive Difference)]]: foundational difference
- [[R(∆)]]: relational embedding
- [[⊚(Rⁿ(∆))]]: stabilization through recursion
- [[Loop(Fₙ)]]: mechanism of closure

---

## Related Concepts

- [[Photon]]: open-form with no loop → no mass
- [[Depth(Fₙ)]]: determines structural persistence
- [[Collapse]]: failure of recursive stabilization

---

## Usage

- Redefines **particles** as recursive difference-structures
- Provides foundation for explaining **coherence**, **confinement**, and **inertia**
- Bridges **matter**, **form**, and **self-sustaining structures** in physics and metaphysics

## Examples / Case Studies

| Form              | Matter? | Reason                                                       |
|-------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Photon            | ❌      | No loop; propagates freely, zero mass                        |
| Electron          | ✅      | Minimal recursive loop; stable, self-sustaining difference   |
| Quark             | ⚠️      | Partial loop; requires group stability (hadrons)             |
| Neutron Star Core | ✅✅    | Extremely deep looped stabilization                          |
| Black Hole        | ✅      | Final state of recursive collapse; loop traps all ∆ paths    |

## Open Questions

- What are the minimal conditions for a loop to persist?
- How do different topologies of loops yield distinct particles?
- Can non-massive matter exist (e.g. via exotic stable configurations)?
