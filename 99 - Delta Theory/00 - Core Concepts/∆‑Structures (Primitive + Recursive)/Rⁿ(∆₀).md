# Rⁿ(∆₀)

## Explanation / Definition

`Rⁿ(∆₀)` denotes the **recursive embedding** of a **primitive difference** `∆₀` into a layered **relational field**. Each application of `R` wraps the previous structure in a new layer of relations, producing increasing complexity and depth.

> `Rⁿ(∆₀) := R(R(...R(∆₀)))` (n times)

This is the **structural skeleton** of all forms in ∆‑theory prior to stabilization.

---

## Ontological Role

- Represents a **nested configuration of difference**, not yet stabilized by `⊚`.
- Serves as the **input to stabilization**, producing forms:  
  > `Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`

- Encodes the **potential for identity**, persistence, and behavior through relational layering.

---

## Primitive / Derived Status

- **Derived**, but **irreducible in practice** due to its foundational role in structuring difference.
- Requires:
  - `∆₀` — a primitive difference
  - `R` — the relational operator

---

## Usage

- **Physics**: Basis of particles, fields, and mass (`Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)`)
- **Mind**: Recursive forms of memory and identity
- **Collapse**: Weakening or unraveling of relational depth
- **Computation**: Layered state, stack-based modeling

## Examples / Case Studies

| Layer (n) | Interpretation                                |
|-----------|-----------------------------------------------|
| 1         | Simple relation (e.g., photon, open form)     |
| 2–4       | Stable form (e.g., particle, memory chunk)    |
| ≫ 10      | Deeply structured identity, cultural system   |

## Expression in ∆‑Theory

> `Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`  
> `Collapse(Fₙ)` ⇔ loss of coherence in `Rⁿ(∆₀)`  
> `mass ∝ depth(Rⁿ)` × loop stability
