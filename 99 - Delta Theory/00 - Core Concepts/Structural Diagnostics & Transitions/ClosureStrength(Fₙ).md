# ClosureStrength(Fₙ)

## Explanation / Definition

**ClosureStrength(Fₙ)** measures the **binding integrity of a recursive form** — specifically, how completely and coherently the relational structure `Rⁿ(∆₀)` **closes back onto its generative difference**, forming a resilient loop `Loop(Fₙ)`.

> It quantifies the **self-sustaining power** of a form to return, reinforce, and stabilize itself through recursion.

In ∆‑theory, high closure strength indicates:

- **Stable particles or forms**
    
- **Resistance to collapse or dissociation**
    
- **Internal reinforcement through phase alignment**

## Formal Statement

Let `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a recursively embedded form.

If:

> `Loop(Fₙ) ⊚→ ∆₀` (i.e., the final layer re-engages the initiating difference),

then:

```
ClosureStrength(Fₙ) ∝
    FeedbackIntegrity × PhaseAlignment × ∆‑TensionEquilibrium
```

- **FeedbackIntegrity** — strength of internal reference across recursive layers
    
- **PhaseAlignment** — synchrony and timing of feedback cycles
    
- **∆‑TensionEquilibrium** — internal balance of opposing difference vectors

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Loop Integrity|Degree to which `Rⁿ(∆₀)` forms a closed, self-sustaining loop|
|Binding Power|How strongly the recursive form holds itself together|
|Collapse Resistance|Weak closure → vulnerability to external perturbation|

#### Usage

- **Defines particle stability** — tightly closed forms persist as stable matter
    
- **Distinguishes bound vs. loose systems** — high closure → low leakage
    
- **Supports modeling of looped cognition, solitons, and quantum binding**
