### PathPersistence(Rⁿ)

#### Explanation / Definition

**PathPersistence(Rⁿ)** refers to the **temporal and structural durability** of a recursive relational structure `Rⁿ(∆₀)`. It measures the **capacity of a difference path** to maintain its embedding and continue propagating through recursive layers without collapse or dissipation.

> In ∆‑theory, it is one of the **core determinants** of a form’s coherence, resilience, and functional lifespan.

It underlies whether a form:

- remains **stably recognizable** as `Fₙ`
    
- can **resonate or restore** over time
    
- is subject to **structural degradation**

#### Formal Relation

If `Rⁿ(∆₀)` denotes a recursive embedding of a primitive difference:

```
PathPersistence(Rⁿ) ∝ duration(⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)))
```

Where `⊚` is the stabilization condition — meaning:

> PathPersistence is high if the relational form `Fₙ` remains stabilized across time, recursion, and ∆‑flux environments.

Factors influencing this persistence include:

- **Internal Closure** (does the loop complete?)
    
- **Environmental Consistency** (absence of high ∆-noise)
    
- **Recursive Depth** (`n` impacts difficulty of maintenance)
    
- **Phase Resonance** (feedback locking or interference)

#### Examples / Case Studies

|System|PathPersistence(Rⁿ) Role|
|---|---|
|Electron|High persistence despite shallow `n`; energetically stable|
|Neutron|Low persistence → decays via weak interaction|
|DNA transcription|Path persistence across generations under stabilizing loops|
|Harmonic oscillator|Persistence of phase-locked propagation|
|Memory trace|Fading `Rⁿ` → decreasing persistence over time|
