# StableForms

## Explanation / Definition

A form `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` is called **stable** if every recursive layer of difference from base ∆₀ up to level *n* is itself stabilized:

> **Formal condition**:
> `Fₙ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ∀ k ∈ [0, n]: ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) holds`

This ensures ontological grounding of the form across all its layers.

## Usage

* Use as a **validation criterion** when modeling multi-level systems.
* Serves as a benchmark for distinguishing truly emergent form from apparent or collapsed structures.
* Applicable in simulations, generative architectures, cognitive systems.

### Examples / Case Studies

* A self-regulating ecosystem with resilient trophic levels.
* A personality structure supported by integrated emotional, cognitive, and narrative layers.
* A mathematical model where foundational axioms are internally consistent and stable.
