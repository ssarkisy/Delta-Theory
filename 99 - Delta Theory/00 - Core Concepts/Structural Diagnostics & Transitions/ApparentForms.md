# ApparentForms

## Explanation / Definition

A form that appears coherent at level *n*, but has at least one destabilized lower layer of difference:

> **Formal condition**:
> `Fₙ ∈ ApparentForms ⇔ ∃ k < n such that ¬⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))`

These forms are **ontologically unsustained** and vulnerable to collapse over time.

## Usage

* Diagnostic tool for evaluating systemic fragility.
* Useful in evaluating psychological states (e.g. functional dissociation), political systems (e.g. democratic decay), or AI reasoning chains with false assumptions.
