# Phase Coherence

## Explanation / Definition

**Phase Coherence** refers to the **temporal alignment of ∆‑propagations** across a shared or coupled relational field. When multiple ∆‑waves remain **in stable synchrony over time**, they preserve constructive interference and relational structure.

In ∆‑theory, coherence is essential for:

- **Sustained resonance**
- **Memory formation**
- **Field coupling**
- **Emergence of stable forms**

> Coherence(∆₁, ∆₂) = ⊚(R(∆₁ + ∆₂))  
> where oscillations of difference remain in stable phase relationship

---

## Formal Conditions

Let `∆₁(t), ∆₂(t)` be difference oscillations within a shared ∆‑Field.

Then **coherence** exists if:

- `phase(∆₁(t)) ≈ phase(∆₂(t))` over a duration T
- Relational mapping `R(∆₁ + ∆₂)` remains **internally stable**

This enables emergent structures like:

- Persistent wave packets  
- Recursive ∆‑loops (e.g., electrons, memory patterns)

## Core Properties

| Property            | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                                 |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Stability  | Phase alignment preserves difference over time        |
| Resonance Enabler   | Prerequisite for stable ∆‑Resonance                    |
| Collapse Delay      | Increases resilience(Fₙ); delays decoherence          |
| Information Carrier | Encodes pattern continuity within difference flow     |

## Usage

- Underlies **stable particle identity** (e.g. spin/mass states)
- Explains **coherent cognition** (attention, focus, memory persistence)
- Forms basis for **signal coherence** in communication and energy transfer

- [[Collapse(Fₙ)]] — Loss of coherence may trigger collapse  
- [[Entanglement]] — Requires coherence across ∆-bound forms  
- [[∆‑Interference]] — May be constructive or destructive depending on phase
