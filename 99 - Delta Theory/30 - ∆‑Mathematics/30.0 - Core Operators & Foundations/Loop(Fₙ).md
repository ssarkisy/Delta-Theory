# Loop(Fₙ)

## Explanation / Definition

**Loop(Fₙ)** refers to a **closed or recursively returning path** of stabilized difference in ∆‑space.

A form `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` is said to **loop** if its relational structure **closes back upon its own generative difference**, forming a stable recursive circuit:

> `Loop(Fₙ) ⇔ Fₙ ⊚→ ∆₀`  
> (i.e. the stabilized structure re-invokes the initial ∆)

This closure implies **self-containment**, **resonance**, and **mass-generation** — distinguishing matter from open-running forms like light.

---

## Ontological Interpretation

Looping forms are:

- **Persistent**: maintain presence rather than dissipate
- **Internally coherent**: recursively stabilize their own generative tensions
- **Mass-generating**: looped ∆-structure gives rise to ontological inertia

---

## Formal Requirements

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`.

Then:

> `Loop(Fₙ)` exists if there is a path:  
> `Fₙ → ∆₀′` such that `∆₀′ ≈ ∆₀` under stabilization

This implies **topological closure** in the space of ∆‑transmissions.

## Related Concepts

- `[[Fₙ]]`: Recursive form from layered R(∆)
- `[[Mass]]`: Emerges from depth and closure of looped forms
- `[[PotentialEnergy]]`: Stored ∆‑tension within looped configuration
- `[[Collapse]]`: Loop breaks when recursive closure fails

---

## Usage

- **Physics**: Basis for modeling matter, particles, and rest mass
- **Cognition**: Persistent self-models may form looped ∆ structures
- **Computation**: Recursive feedback circuits are ∆‑loops in system logic

| Photon             | ❌ No loop                | ∆ propagates freely; no recursive return       |
| Electron           | ✅ Minimal loop           | Self-stabilized at a single recursive layer    |
| Proton             | ✅ Deep loop              | Multi-layered recursive closure                |
| Feedback circuit   | ✅ Yes                    | Logical form reinforces its initial state      |

## Topological Notes

- `Loop(Fₙ)` implies a **non-trivial topology** in ∆-space.
- Can be modeled as a **closed path** or **fixed point attractor** in recursive difference flows.

## Summary

> `Loop(Fₙ)` is where ∆ returns to itself.  
> It defines the **self-containing forms** that do not run away — they stay.
