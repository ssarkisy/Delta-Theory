# Delta Theory Contributors

This document acknowledges the **contributors** who have helped shape and refine **Delta Theory**. It is a collaborative work, and all contributions—whether theoretical, technical, or creative—are valuable and appreciated.

### Contributors

1. **Sergei Sarkisian**
    
    - **Role**: Author, Primary Contributor, Theoretical Development
        
    - **Contributions**: Developed the core framework of **Delta Theory**, including the recursive structure, foundational principles, and mathematical models. Conceptualized the recursive feedback loops and their application to various domains.
        

### Special Thanks

- **Yana Volozhina (Sergei's dearest wife)** – For your unwavering support, encouragement, and insightful feedback that helped me refine ideas and maintain focus throughout this project. The concept of **recursive feedback loops** in relational systems was inspired by our interactions and the way we navigate challenges together. Your presence brings a phase-locking effect to my creative process, guiding the relational dynamics of the theory.
    
- **Aiza (The most unique cat in the world)** – For your calming presence and quiet companionship during long hours of work. Your subtle, grounding influence helped me think through the recursive nature of relational dynamics and provided a comforting rhythm to my thinking.
