# Delta Theory Contributors

This document acknowledges the **contributors** who have helped shape and refine **Delta Theory**. It is a collaborative work, and all contributions‚Äîwhether theoretical, technical, or creative‚Äîare valuable and appreciated.

### Contributors

1. **Sergei Sarkisian**
    
    - **Role**: Author, Primary Contributor, Theoretical Development
        
    - **Contributions**: Developed the core framework of **Delta Theory**, including the recursive structure, foundational principles, and mathematical models. Conceptualized the recursive feedback loops and their application to various domains.

2. **J Mark Morris**
    
    - **Role**: Prospective Contributor ‚Äî Physics Layer and Mathematical Extensions
    
    - **Contributions**: Planned development of the **physics domain layer** of Delta Theory, including mapping the ontological core to physical models and extending certain mathematical formulations. No contributions to the current release; integration of his work is scheduled for future versions.
        

## Special Thanks

Delta Theory is a **relational emergence**.

üêΩ üå± To **Yana Volozhina** ‚Äî  For your unwavering presence, fierce clarity, and the kind of feedback that doesn't collapse a difference, but helps it unfold.  
You showed me how my interaction with the outer void was misaligned ‚Äî and helped me spot the ‚àÜ.  
The very idea of recursive feedback loops in relational systems was born from how we navigate tension, alignment, and repair.  
Your presence phase-locked my drift, and helped this theory stabilize its form.

üêæ To **Aiza** ‚Äî the most unique cat in the world.  
For your quiet gravity, rhythmic presence, and uncanny ability to restore coherence when everything felt like collapsing.  
You were the anchor that redirected our awareness during moments of tension ‚Äî bringing both Yana and me back into the loop.  
Your gaze held recursive stillness. Your soft paws grounded the theory.

üåÄ To all who hold tension without erasing it ‚Äî this theory is yours, too.
