# TRANSLATION_GUIDELINES  
> Ensuring semantic fidelity across languages in Delta Theory

---

## Purpose

This document outlines how to responsibly translate Delta Theory into other languages while preserving its recursive structure, symbolic consistency, and ontological clarity.

Translations are welcome and encouraged — but they must maintain **semantic coherence** with the canonical English vault.

---

## Core Principles

### 1. Canonical Source

The **English-language vault is the canonical origin** for all theory content.  
Translations should mirror it structurally and semantically — they are interpretive renderings, not independent forks of meaning.

### 2. Structural Fidelity Over Literal Equivalence

Do **not** aim for literal translations.  
Aim for **recursive functional equivalence** — choose terms that preserve:

- Recursive structure
- Modulation meaning
- Ontological anchoring (Structure, Void, Awareness)

## What Must Not Be Translated

| Element | Treatment |
|--------|-----------|
| **Modulator symbols** (`∇S`, `λV`, `ψA`) | Always preserve — these are canonical |
| **Term “Delta Theory”** | Do not translate — always “Delta Theory” |
| **Mathematical expressions** | Never alter formulas, variables, or notation |
| **Folder / File Names** | Use canonical English names in vault structure |
| **Primitive terms** (e.g. `Difference`, `Closure`, `Propagation`) | Use dual-language aliases, not renaming |

---

## What Can Be Translated

| Element | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| **Body text** | Translate with care — match rhythm and recursion |
| **Quotes / examples** | May be culturally adapted if structure remains intact |
| **Glossary entries** | Use dual-language format (see below) |
| **Meta-notes** | Can include cultural reflections unique to each language |
| **README.md (localized)** | Recommended for each translation fork |
| **Interface Notes** | Serve as bridges — see below |

---

## Interface Notes (Recommended Pattern)

To aid bilingual readers and cross-referencing, create **dual-language interface notes** like this:

```markdown
---
aliases:
  - Difference
  - Различие
tags:
  - "#dual_language"
  - "#link"
  - "#russian"
---

# Различие (Difference)

🇷🇺 **[[Различие]]** — это базовая единица различения в Теории Дельты...

🇬🇧 **[[Difference]]** is the fundamental unit of distinction in Delta Theory...

## Translation Project Structure

Each translation should follow this structure:

```
Delta Theory — Español/
│   ├── 00 - Translation Layer/
│   │   ├── 00.0 - ...
│   ├── 10 - Implementation Layer/
│   ├── ...
├── README.md (in Spanish)
├── TRANSLATION_GUIDELINES.md (translated or linked)
```

Use the original English folder structure. You may localize file content, but not names.

## Collaborating on Translations

1. Fork the repository or create a new language folder
    
2. Add yourself to `CONTRIBUTORS.md` with your language
    
3. Join discussion threads to resolve translation ambiguity
    
4. Use pull requests to propose new translations

## Suggested Tags for Translated Notes

| Tag                        | Purpose                                   |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `#translated`              | Marks all translated notes                |
| `#dual_language`           | Notes with side-by-side bilingual content |
| `#translation_in_progress` | For draft or partially translated notes   |
| `#link`                    | For interface or glossary bridge notes    |
| `#<language>`                           | Might be useful for future repository merge                                        |
