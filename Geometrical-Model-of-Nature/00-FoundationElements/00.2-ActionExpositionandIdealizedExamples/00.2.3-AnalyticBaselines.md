# 00.2.3 â€” Delay-Only Formulations (Exact Statements)

Purpose:
- State the delay differential equations (DDEs) that govern canonical interactions under the delayed, purely radial law.
- Record exact analytical solutions only where they exist; otherwise, state solvability status without approximations.

Models:
- Fixed center (test particle, source stationary):
  - DDE reduces exactly to the ODE $\ddot{r}=-K/r^2$ with $K=\kappa |q q'|>0$; exact closed forms exist.
- Two-body mutual interaction (opposite or equal charges):
  - Coupled DDEs with causal roots $t_0$ defined by $|x_i(t)-x_j(t_0)|=t-t_0$ (v=1); accelerations superpose as $\pm \kappa \epsilon^2/r^2$ along the line of action.
  - No exact closed-form solutions are presently known for the coupled DDEs in general.

Deliverables:
- Precise DDE forms and causal-root conditions for use in analysis and computation.
- Cross-references to sections with exact solutions (fixed source) and status notes (mutual interaction).

Plain language: We give only the exact delayed equations; where an exact solution exists (fixed source), we present it, and where it does not (mutual interaction), we say so without approximations.
