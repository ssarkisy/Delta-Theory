# 00.2.3.1 — Radial Fall to Fixed Center (Test Particle)

Setup:
- A test Architrino with charge q′ falls radially toward a fixed center with charge q (central 1/r² reference).
- Ignore delay and modulation to obtain exact closed-form relations; use as a baseline.

Objectives:
- Closed-form relations for r(t), v(r), and time-to-fall from r0 to r.
- Energy balance and integral expressions suitable for comparison.

Baseline solution (central model):
- Equation: a(r) = −K/r² with K ∝ κ |q q′|.
- Energy integral: (1/2) v² − K/r = const.
- Time-of-fall from r0 to r: t(r) = ∫_{r}^{r0} dr / √(2(E + K/r)) (provide standard antiderivatives for E≤0).

Mapping to canonical law:
- This baseline matches the v≪1, small-delay limit of the canonical law when the source is much heavier (effectively fixed) or when comparing over very short timescales.

Use:
- A ground-truth closed form against which delayed-law simulations can be benchmarked for early times and slow speeds.

Plain language: Falling straight in toward a fixed center has exact formulas—use them as a ruler for the more realistic, delayed problem.
