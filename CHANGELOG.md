# Changelog

This project adheres to a human‑readable changelog. Versions reference GitHub releases; unreleased items track upcoming work.

## [Unreleased] — v0.0.2 (in progress)

- Added PRINCIPLES.md (replaces AXIOMS.md)
  - Includes core axioms (A1–A3) and governance principle G1 — Dual‑Register Virtualization
  - Added “Why this is necessary” rationale (biology ≠ networks; tech ≠ biology; different invariants require a bridge)
- README updates
  - New Onboarding section linking to PRINCIPLES.md
  - Core principles now link to PRINCIPLES.md
- VAULT_STRUCTURE.md: contribution guidelines now reference PRINCIPLES.md
- ROADMAP.md: added pointer to PRINCIPLES.md and detailed v0.0.2 plan
- Refactored 00 - Ontological Seeding.md
  - Reframed as dual‑register seeding (technical + humane) with cross‑register stabilization path and two register‑specific formula sketches
- Zenodo metadata (.zenodo.json): clarified non‑software upload and dual‑register description

Why: Establish and enforce the dual‑polarity governance principle, improve contributor onboarding, and align Level 1 with bi‑tech dual‑channel strategy prior to v0.0.2.

## [0.0.1] — initial release

- Repository bootstrap with kernel: primitives, modulators (SVA), constants (ε, π, e, φ, c)
- Created CITATION.cff (generic work) and README with formulas and anchor tables
- Added DOI badge and How to cite; configured Zenodo metadata
- Organized informational layer (glossary, diagnostics, relations) and anchors for math/physics domain instances

Why: Provide a coherent, citable ontological kernel and stable structure for subsequent refactoring and domain integrations.
