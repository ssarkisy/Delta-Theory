# Changelog

This project adheres to a human‑readable changelog. Versions reference GitHub releases; unreleased items track upcoming work.

## [v0.3.0] — Environment & Coherence (planned)

Focus: Complete Execution Environment and Coherence Orchestration modules
- Execution Environment (00.0.1) with λV modulation
- Coherence Orchestration (00.0.2) with ψA modulation
- Documentation and integration updates

## [v0.2.0] — Translation Layer Virtualization

### Added
- PRINCIPLES.md with dual-register governance
  - Core axioms (A1–A3) for ontological foundation
  - G1 principle for dual-register requirement
  - Design rationale for bi-polar stability
- New templates with dual-register support
  - meta-index.md for folder organization
  - glossary.md with scale effects
  - glossary-diagnostic.md with scale-aware tests
  - primitive.md with dual-register mapping
  - constant.md with technical/humane aspects
  - axiom.md with polarity alignment

### Changed
- Refactored Translation Layer (00) structure
  - Virtual Substrate (00.0.0) with dual-register mapping
  - Core Axioms (00.0.0.0) with polarity alignment
  - Anchors & Modulators (00.0.0.1) with scale effects
  - Structural Primitives (00.0.0.2) with clear bridges
- Enhanced all index files
  - Simplified structure
  - Removed template redundancy
  - Added clear module purposes
  - Improved organization
- Updated documentation
  - README with dual-register principle
  - ROADMAP with clear version targets
  - CITATION.cff with version 0.2.0
  - Contribution guidelines in PRINCIPLES.md

### Fixed
- LaTeX formatting in Math/Physics constants
- Polarity alignment in axioms
- Template section ordering
- Index file consistency
- Version number alignment

Why: Establish dual-register virtualization as core governance principle, improve contributor onboarding, and align Translation Layer with bi-tech dual-channel strategy.

## [v0.1.0] — Initial Release

- Repository bootstrap with kernel: primitives, modulators (SVA), constants (ε, π, e, φ, c)
- Created CITATION.cff (generic work) and README with formulas and anchor tables
- Added DOI badge and How to cite; configured Zenodo metadata
- Organized informational layer (glossary, diagnostics, relations) and anchors for math/physics domain instances

Why: Provide a coherent, citable ontological kernel and stable structure for subsequent refactoring and domain integrations.
