# Delta Theory

**Delta Theory** (∆‑Theory) is a foundational framework that models the **recursive nature** of **difference** (∆) and its propagation across various systems. The theory emphasizes the role of **recursive feedback loops** and the dynamics of **energy, tension, and entropy** as recursive systems evolve and stabilize. Delta Theory provides a unique lens through which we can view not only **physical systems** but also **cognitive, relational, and social systems**, all governed by recursive principles of **difference**.

## Key Concepts

1. **Difference (∆)**: The fundamental entity in Delta Theory, representing the core of change and modulation within recursive systems.
    
2. **Recursive Feedback Loops**: The mechanisms by which systems self-regulate and evolve, maintaining coherence through continuous feedback.
    
3. **Recursive Systems**: Systems where each part influences and is influenced by the others in a loop, often leading to **emergent behavior** and **self-organization**.
    
4. **Energy and Tension**: The driving forces in recursive systems, where **tension** represents gradients of **difference**, and **energy** represents the recursive propagation of that difference.
    
5. **Recursive Modulation**: The dynamic process by which recursive systems adjust their parameters (such as tension, energy, or feedback loops) to stabilize or evolve over time.

## How to Use

This repository contains the **Delta Theory** framework along with theoretical documentation, examples, and models to help you understand and apply the theory in various domains. To get started:

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ssarkisy/delta-theory.git
cd delta-theory
```

### 2. Explore the Theory:

Start by reading through the **00 - Project** folder, which contains essential background and structural documentation. Please note that the structure of the **meta-documentation** is still being refined and may evolve to a more optimal form as the theory progresses. Your feedback and contributions are welcome to help improve this organization over time.

Key sections to begin with:

- **00.1 - Project Overview**: Provides an introduction to the **Delta Theory** project, explaining its purpose, goals, and overall structure.
    
- **00.2 - Theoretical Foundations**: Explores the core principles behind **Delta Theory**, including its recursive nature, how difference propagates, and its application to various systems.
    
    - **Core Principles of Delta Theory**: A deep dive into the foundational ideas of **Delta Theory**.
        
    - **Singularity as Structural Boundary**: Discusses how recursive systems, like **Black Holes** and **White Holes**, exemplify recursive boundary structures.
        
    - **Recursive Propagation Dynamics**: Examines how difference propagates through recursive feedback loops, affecting systems’ stability and evolution.
        
- **00.3 - Domain Reflections**: Explores how **Delta Theory** applies to real-world systems, such as cognition, physics, and relational dynamics.
    
    - **Recursive Identity in Cognition**: Discusses the recursive nature of mental processes and cognitive feedback loops.
        
    - **Stability Through Difference in Systems**: Looks at how **recursive feedback loops** stabilize complex systems.
        
- **00.4 - Practical Examples**: Includes concrete examples of how **Delta Theory** is applied to different domains, providing both theoretical and practical insights.
    
    - **Examples of Recursive Systems**: Offers examples from domains such as physics, cognition, and relational systems (e.g., family dynamics).
    

### 3. Apply the Theory:

You can find **examples** and **model instantiations** in the **00.4 - Practical Examples** folder. These show how the theory applies to different domains, such as:

- **Physics**: Understanding **difference propagation** in physical systems like **particles**, **fields**, and **energy exchanges**.
    
- **Cognition**: Modeling the **recursive loops** within mental processes and cognitive feedback.
    
- **Analyzing the recursive dynamics of relational systems**, including interactions between individuals, groups, and environments. This application explores how **difference** propagates through relationships and how feedback loops influence **coherence** and **stability** in personal, social, and organizational contexts.
    

### 4. Visualize the Theory:

Diagrams and visual models can be found in the **assets/** folder. Key visualizations include:

- **Difference Propagation Cycle**: A diagram illustrating the recursive **flow of difference** across systems.
    
- **Recursive Feedback Loop**: A visual model showing how **recursive systems** stabilize through continuous feedback.
