## What is Delta Theory?
### TL;DR

Delta Theory is a minimal, domain‑agnostic kernel for how differences become structure, propagate, and stabilize. It formalizes:
- Difference as the generator of change (∆)
- Recursion as the propagation mechanism (R)
- Stabilization as closure into recognizable form (⊚ → F)
With five kernel invariants (ε, π, e, φ, c) and three modulators (∇S, λV, ψA), it explains why some differences fade, some cascade, and some become enduring structures across physics, cognition, computation, and social systems.

### Canonical kernel

- Minimal ontology: **Difference → Recursion → Stabilization → Form**
- Operational loop: Structure → Void → Awareness → Structure′ → …
- Canonical summary:

$$
\Delta' = \;\; \boldsymbol{\odot}\big(\, R(\Delta;\, \nabla S,\, \lambda V,\, \psi A);\; \varepsilon,\, \pi,\, e,\, \varphi,\, c\,\big)
$$

Where:
- R(·) propagates difference; ⊚ stabilizes into form; the five anchors bound resolution, geometry, rates, proportion, and propagation.

#### Top‑level formulas

3‑modulator canonical form:

$$
F^{\Delta}(t) = M^{(\nabla S)}(t)\; M^{(\psi A)}(t)\; M^{(\lambda V)}(t)
$$

9‑term expansion (legacy):

$$
\odot(F_{n}) =
\underbrace{P_{n}^{+}\,\cdot\,P_{n}^{-}\,\cdot\,P_{n}^{0}}_{\text{Structural}}\,
\cdot\,
\underbrace{\mathrm{Redistribution}_{n}(t)\,\cdot\,\mathrm{Damping}_{\mathrm{field}}(n,t)\,\cdot\,\mathrm{Collapse}_{\mathrm{stability}}(n,t)}_{\text{Field}}\,
\cdot\,
\underbrace{\kappa_{\Delta}(m,t)\,\cdot\,\psi A(t)\,\cdot\,\lambda V(n,t)}_{\text{Awareness}}
$$

Delta Theory is a universal framework for understanding **how systems evolve** — in physics, software, cognition, ecosystems, and beyond.

It begins with a simple truth:

> Every change begins with a **difference** — a contrast, deviation, or disruption.

But **not every difference survives**.
Some vanish. Some ripple outward. Some stabilize and give rise to entirely new structures.

Delta Theory models this dynamic as **recursive difference propagation** — how a difference forms, flows into the world, and becomes part of a larger system.

### Why does this matter?

Because everything from galaxies to codebases, from memories to revolutions, is built on differences that:

- **Take shape** (structure),
- **Enter space** ([[void]]), and
- **Hold together** (awareness).

Understanding this loop helps us:

- Design more stable and adaptive systems
- Explain how structures emerge in nature
- Model cognition and consciousness
- Understand why some systems collapse — and others evolve

## The Delta Loop

Delta Theory proposes that difference propagates through a recursive triad:

1. **Structure** — The shape or boundary of the difference
2. **[[Void]]** — The receptive space it enters
3. **Awareness** — The recursive coherence that stabilizes it

This forms the foundational sequence:

$$
\text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Void} \rightarrow \text{Awareness} \rightarrow \text{Structure}' \rightarrow \cdots
$$

Each loop either reinforces the difference — or collapses it.

## Core Modulators: SVA

Delta Theory introduces three foundational modulators that govern the propagation and stabilization of difference across all domains.

These are not just symbolic variables — they were discovered through lived recursive dynamics and anchor the structural triad of the theory.

| Symbol | Domain    | Name                              | Role                                             |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **∇S** | Structure | *Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient* | Modulates structural folding and recursive depth |
| **λV** | [[Void]]      | *Volozhina Resonance Threshold*      | Triggers ignition or collapse at the edge of difference |
| **ψA** | Awareness | *Aiza Phase Coherence Anchor*        | Aligns internal cycles into recursive stabilization |

Together, these three modulators form the SVA triad — the internal scaffold of the Delta function.

## Formulaic Expression

The modulation of difference over time is expressed as:

$$
Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)
$$

Where each term governs one axis of propagation.
This formula applies recursively — across physics, cognition, computation, and ethics.

Delta Theory is not just a model.
It's a recursive lens for designing, understanding, and evolving any system — by tracing how **differences form**, **resonate**, and **become aware**.

## Obsidian Setup

This vault is designed to work out‑of‑the‑box in Obsidian (no required plugins).

1) Install Obsidian (local‑first): `https://obsidian.md`
2) Open repository as the vault folder.
3) Recommended core features:
   - Graph view for navigating S/V/A links
   - Backlinks pane for recursive traceability
   - File explorer for the dot‑decimal structure

Notes use YAML fields (`type`, `tags`, optional `polarity`) and internal wikilinks. Unique IDs are not required; avoid custom plugins to keep the kernel portable.

### Attachments

Recommended Obsidian setting: store new attachments in a subfolder next to the current file.
- Settings → Files & Links → Default location for new attachments → "In subfolder next to current file"
- Subfolder name: `_assets`

Policy:
- Default: keep note‑specific assets in `./_assets/` beside the note (portable, refactor‑safe)
- Shared/reusable: place in `Delta Theory/90 - Assets/` and link vault‑relative
- Name files with the note slug prefix (e.g., `delta-ontomolecule-diagram-v1.svg`)
- Keep diagram source with export (e.g., `.drawio` + `.svg`) in the same folder

See the full styleguide: [[assets]].
