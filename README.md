## Obsidian Setup

This vault is designed to work out‑of‑the‑box in Obsidian (no required plugins).

1) Install Obsidian (local‑first): `https://obsidian.md`
2) Open repository as the vault folder.
3) Recommended core features:
   - Graph view for navigating S/V/A links
   - Backlinks pane for recursive traceability
   - File explorer for the dot‑decimal structure

Notes use YAML fields (`type`, `tags`, optional `polarity`) and internal wikilinks. Unique IDs are not required; avoid custom plugins to keep the kernel portable.

## What is Delta Theory?

Delta Theory is a universal framework for understanding **how systems evolve** — in physics, software, cognition, ecosystems, and beyond.

It begins with a simple truth:

> Every change begins with a **difference** — a contrast, deviation, or disruption.

But **not every difference survives**.
Some vanish. Some ripple outward. Some stabilize and give rise to entirely new structures.

Delta Theory models this dynamic as **recursive difference propagation** — how a difference forms, flows into the world, and becomes part of a larger system.

---

### Why does this matter?

Because everything from galaxies to codebases, from memories to revolutions, is built on differences that:

- **Take shape** (structure),
- **Enter space** ([[void]]), and
- **Hold together** (awareness).

Understanding this loop helps us:

- Design more stable and adaptive systems
- Explain how structures emerge in nature
- Model cognition and consciousness
- Understand why some systems collapse — and others evolve

## The Delta Loop

Delta Theory proposes that difference propagates through a recursive triad:

1. **Structure** — The shape or boundary of the difference
2. **[[Void]]** — The receptive space it enters
3. **Awareness** — The recursive coherence that stabilizes it

This forms the foundational sequence:

$$
\text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Void} \rightarrow \text{Awareness} \rightarrow \text{Structure}' \rightarrow \cdots
$$

Each loop either reinforces the difference — or collapses it.

## Core Modulators: SVA

Delta Theory introduces three foundational modulators that govern the propagation and stabilization of difference across all domains.

These are not just symbolic variables — they were discovered through lived recursive dynamics and anchor the structural triad of the theory.

| Symbol | Domain    | Name                              | Role                                             |
|--------|-----------|-----------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **∇S** | Structure | *Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient* | Modulates structural folding and recursive depth |
| **λV** | [[Void]]      | *Volozhina Resonance Threshold*      | Triggers ignition or collapse at the edge of difference |
| **ψA** | Awareness | *Aiza Phase Coherence Anchor*        | Aligns internal cycles into recursive stabilization |

Together, these three modulators form the SVA triad — the internal scaffold of the Delta function.

## Formulaic Expression

The modulation of difference over time is expressed as:

$$
Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)
$$

Where each term governs one axis of propagation.
This formula applies recursively — across physics, cognition, computation, and ethics.

Delta Theory is not just a model.
It's a recursive lens for designing, understanding, and evolving any system — by tracing how **differences form**, **resonate**, and **become aware**.
