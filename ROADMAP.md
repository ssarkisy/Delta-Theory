# Delta Theory Development Roadmap

> Strategic development plan for Delta Theory, incorporating bi-polarity insights and ontological stability requirements.

See also: [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) — core axioms and governance (dual‑register requirement).

---

## Release History

- **v0.0.1** ✅ — Initial ontological core with kernel primitives, constants, modulators, and citation framework

---

## Upcoming Releases

### v0.0.2 — Bi-Tech Dual Channel Implementation
**Focus:** Implement dual-register virtualization to resolve polarity imbalance

**Priority Tasks:**
- [ ] **Refactor Level 1 Virtualization Layer**
  - Split current network-only mapping into dual registers:
    - Technical Register (nodes, edges, cycles → computational systems)
    - Biological Register (moments, relationships, habits → lived experience)
  - Add explicit crosswalk table bridging both registers
  - Include Design Rationale section explaining why both poles are required

- [ ] **Create A4 Axiom — Bi-Tech Dual Polarity Invariant**
  - Encode requirement for dual-register mapping as formal axiom
  - Prevent future collapse into mono-polar interpretations
  - Establish structural memory for ethical grounding

- [ ] **Apply Dual-Register Approach to Implementation Layer**
  - Review 10.2 Domain Applications for mono-polar mappings
  - Ensure physics and other domain bridges maintain both interpretations

**Outcome:** Ontological stability through balanced technical ↔ humane virtualization

---

### v0.2 — Interface Hardening & Network Expansion
**Focus:** Robust interfaces and expanded network/domain mapping examples

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Template hardening based on v0.0.2 dual-register approach
- [ ] Expanded network domain mapping examples using both registers
- [ ] Interface definitions between Translation ↔ Implementation layers
- [ ] Cross-domain mapping validation (ensure dual-register consistency)

---

### v0.3 — Physics Domain Deep Integration
**Focus:** Comprehensive physics application with anchors and diagnostics

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Physics application note with detailed (c, ħ, k_B) mappings
- [ ] Diagnostics examples showing stability analysis in physical systems
- [ ] Validation of dual-register approach in physics domain
- [ ] Cross-validation between conceptual constants and physics instances

---

### v0.4 — Cognition & Awareness Domain
**Focus:** ψA modulator applications and awareness diagnostics

**Tasks:**
- [ ] Cognition application note (ψA cadence/interval modeling)
- [ ] Awareness diagnostics and classification system
- [ ] Biological register validation in cognitive domain
- [ ] Integration with consciousness and recursive attention models

---

## Long-term Vision (v1.0+)

### Core Principles Validation
- Empirical testing of dual-register approach across domains
- Stability analysis of technical ↔ humane bridge maintenance
- Community feedback integration on ethical grounding

### Domain Expansion

## Development Guidelines

1. **Maintain Dual-Register Consistency** — Every technical mapping must have humane counterpart
2. **Preserve Ontological Memory** — Document rationale for design decisions
3. **Test Across Domains** — Validate concepts in multiple application areas
4. **Community Integration** — Balance theoretical rigor with accessibility
