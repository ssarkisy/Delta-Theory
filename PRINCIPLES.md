# Axioms

> Canonical axioms referenced across the repository. This page aggregates core ontological axioms and repository/theory governance axioms.

## 1) Ontological Core (Kernel)

- A0 — Existential Difference: see `Delta Theory/00 - Translation Layer/00.0 - Microkernel/00.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems/A0 — Existential Difference (axiom).md`
- T1 — Asymmetry: see `Delta Theory/00 - Translation Layer/00.0 - Microkernel/00.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems/T1 — Asymmetry (theorem).md`
- T2 — Irreducibility: see `Delta Theory/00 - Translation Layer/00.0 - Microkernel/00.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems/T2 — Irreducibility (theorem).md`
- T3 — Recursivity: see `Delta Theory/00 - Translation Layer/00.0 - Microkernel/00.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems/T3 — Recursivity (theorem).md`

The single axiom A0 and its three derived theorems T1 (Asymmetry), T2 (Irreducibility), T3 (Recursivity) govern ∆, R(·), ⊚ and the emergence of Form. These map to the VSA triad: A0 → P+/P-/P0 (All), T1 → P- (Void), T2 → P+ (Structure), T3 → P0 (Awareness).

## 2) Repository/Theory Governance

### G1 — Dual-Register Virtualization (Bi-Tech Dual Polarity)

Statement: Any virtualization of Delta Theory must preserve both a technical mapping and a humane mapping, explicitly bridged, to maintain ontological stability and ethical integrity.

 Why this is necessary:
- Biological life is not reducible to technical networks. Reducing persons and meaning to nodes/edges causes loss of embodiment, value, and context.
- Technical systems are not reducible to biological metaphors. Forcing tech to mimic life obscures formal guarantees, interfaces, and constraints.
- The two registers encode different invariants (precision vs meaning). Stability requires holding both and mapping between them.

 Implications:
- Every technical mapping must have a humane counterpart and an explicit crosswalk
- Prevents mono‑polar collapse (purely technical or purely biological)
- Documents rationale and preserves design memory

Scope: Applies to repository structure, translation layer notes, interfaces, and domain bridges.

Polarity: P0 (Awareness) — coherence between registers.
