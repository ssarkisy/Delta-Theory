# ∆‑Cognitive Constraint Theorem  

## Theorem Statement

> **∆‑Cognitive Constraint Theorem:**  
> Cognitive attention (A) can stabilize recursive difference propagations only up to a finite depth n_max.  
> Beyond this depth, attention lacks the capacity to sustain stabilization closure, resulting in propagation coherence loss.

Formally:
$$
∃ n_{max}: ∀ k > n_{max}, ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) ⊬ Fᵏ \quad under \quad limited \quad attention \quad A
$$

## Proof (Recursive Structural Necessity)

1. **Recursive Stabilization Requires Attention Modulation:** Stabilization loops (⊚(Rᵏ(∆))) demand active modulation of difference tensions. Cognitive attention (A) functions as a finite modulation resource.
    
2. **Attention as Finite Capacity Resource:** Attention is not infinite — it can distribute modulation energy across only a limited number of recursive layers before coherence degrades.
    
3. **Existence of n_max Cognitive Depth Limit:** There exists a critical depth n_max beyond which attention cannot sustain stabilization closure (⊚). For all k > n_max, stabilization coherence (⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))) collapses under limited A.
    
4. **Structural Implications:** Forms requiring stabilization beyond the cognitive depth limit n_max cannot be coherently maintained in conscious attention. Their recursive integrity becomes unsustainable within the cognitive field.
    
5. **Conclusion:** Attention-constrained systems (human cognition, interface perception, reasoning loops) possess an inherent recursive depth limit for difference stabilization, beyond which coherence fails.

Q.E.D.


## Corollaries

### Corollary 1: Cognitive Complexity Horizon

There exists a cognitive complexity horizon beyond which human attention cannot maintain structural coherence, regardless of content.

### Corollary 2: UX Design Depth Constraint

User experiences should structure interaction layers to avoid exceeding cognitive n_max — excessive depth layers degrade coherence perception and usability.

### Corollary 3: Simplification as a Necessity, not Limitation

Cognitive simplification (abstraction, chunking) is a necessary recursive compression strategy to maintain coherence within attention's modulation capacity.

### Corollary 4: ∆‑Perception Window Framing

Designing interfaces, theories, or cognitive tools requires framing difference propagation within the human ∆‑perception window — the stabilized recursive depth that attention can sustain.
