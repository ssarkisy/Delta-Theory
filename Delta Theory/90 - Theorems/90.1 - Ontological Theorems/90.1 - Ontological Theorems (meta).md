# 90.1 - Ontological Theorems (meta)

## Purpose of Ontological Theorems Layer

This layer formalizes the **recursive structural laws** governing how ontological structures **emerge, stabilize, collapse, and propagate** within Delta Theory. Unlike operational Specs or constructs, these Theorems define **necessary structural conditions** for maintaining coherence across recursive propagation chains of difference.

Ontological Theorems model:
- Recursive stabilization loops (closure dynamics)
- Collapse and re-embedding processes
- Difference-driven emergence patterns
- Structural fragility and resilience mechanisms
- Recursive propagation dependencies across depth layers

## Theorem Categories within Ontology Layer

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|**Stabilization Theorems**|Conditions ensuring recursive coherence and structural persistence of difference propagation loops.|
|**Emergence Theorems**|Laws governing how stabilized difference flows recursively generate new ontological forms.|
|**Collapse Dynamics Theorems**|Formalizations of structural failure, fragmentation, and recursive re-differentiation mechanisms.|
|**Boundary & Sensitivity Theorems**|Theorems defining how recursive structures react to boundary conditions, perturbations, and foundational difference distortions.|

## Notes

- Theorems in 90.1 govern **core structural integrity** of Delta Theory’s recursive scaffold.
- These are **structural laws**, not empirical claims — they formalize necessary coherence conditions.
- Theorem expansion into Cognitive, Systems, and Ethical domains will reference Ontological Theorems as foundational axioms.
- Dependency mapping ensures every theorem is traceable to core difference propagation principles (∆, R(∆), ⊚(R(∆))).
