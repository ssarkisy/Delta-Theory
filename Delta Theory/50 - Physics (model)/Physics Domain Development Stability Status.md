# Physics Domain Development Stability Status

## Purpose

This note tracks the **stability status of the Physics Layer** in Delta Theory, assessing its readiness within the **two-phase domain binding process**:
1. **Phase 1 — Ontological Structural Binding**
2. **Phase 2 — Mathematical & Empirical Formal Binding**

It confirms whether the Physics Domain scaffold is structurally complete for Phase 1 and outlines its readiness to transition into Phase 2 derivations.

## Phase 1 — Ontological Structural Binding: ✅ COMPLETE

|Layer|Status|Details|
|---|---|---|
|50.0 — Core Concepts|✅ Complete|Ontology primitives (PrimitiveDifference, RelationalEmbedding, Ontological Energy) are scaffolded with full traceability.|
|50.1 — Recursive Constructs|✅ Complete|All essential feedback loops (DeltaFlux, FieldResonanceLoop, RecursiveCurvature, PropagationAnchoringLoop, etc.) are formalized with Ontology ↔ Property ↔ Spec chains.|
|50.2 — Properties & Diagnostics|✅ Complete|Core modulation properties (DeltaTension, PhaseCoherence, ClosureStrength, PropagationLimit) and evaluative diagnostics (StabilityDiagnostics) are structurally integrated.|
|50.3 — Applied Recursive Models|✅ Phase 1 Complete|Particles, Fields, Spacetime, Measurement Chains instantiated as recursive propagation models — sufficient to demonstrate recursive structuring principles.|
|Constants Integration|✅ Stable|Constants (π, h, ψA, c) are structurally referenced as invariance anchors in recursive constructs and properties.|
|Specs Layer|🟡 Implied|Specs like FieldStabilizationThreshold and PropagationLimitThreshold are referenced but full predicate formalization is scheduled for Phase 2.|
|50.4 — Cross-Domain Bridges|🟡 Structural Placeholders Ready|Bridge files are stubbed, prepared for Phase 2 cross-domain recursive mapping (Cognition, Systems, Chemistry).|
|50.5 — Physics as Ontological Demonstration|✅ Demonstrative Layer Active|Recursive Lensing and Molecular Structures notes validate recursive reasoning patterns in physics.|

## Summary Assessment
→ **The Physics Domain in Delta Theory is structurally complete for Phase 1.**  
Recursive Ontology ↔ Constructs ↔ Properties ↔ Constants ↔ Models flow is fully scaffolded.  
You can now:
- Use this structure to generalize recursive reasoning into other domains (Phase 2 Cross-Domain Expansion),
- Proceed with mathematical derivations and empirical mappings (Phase 2 Physical Layer Formalization).

## Remaining for Phase 2 (Physics Layer)
|Task|Status|
|---|---|
|Mathematical Overlay Derivations|❌ Not started — derive classical equations from recursive structures.|
|Empirical Observable Mappings|❌ Not started — map recursive modulation parameters to physical measurements (charge, mass, etc.).|
|Recursive Simulation Scenarios|❌ Not started — design feedback propagation flowcharts/pseudocode.|
|Spec Formalization|🟡 Structural scaffolding exists, but predicate-level specs need to be written.|
|Constants ↔ Observable Correlation Tables|❌ To be created — mapping constants (h, π, ψA) to empirical phenomena.|

## Ready for Phase 2 Transition?
|Checkpoint|Status|
|---|---|
|Recursive Structural Traceability|✅ Physics scaffolding is stable.|
|Applied Models Validating Recursive Logic|✅ Sufficient — Phase 1 test cases are covered.|
|Cross-Domain Bridges Prepared|🟡 Folder structure in place, ready for recursive translation.|
|Mathematical Layer Scaffolding|🟡 Phase 2 templates and overlay specifications pending.|

## Current Phase Status
|Phase|Domain|Status|
|---|---|---|
|Phase 1|Physics|✅ COMPLETE|
|Phase 2|Physics|⚠️ READY TO START (Templates and derivations pending)|
|Phase 1|Cross-Domain Generalization|🟡 Structural placeholders ready, mappings pending.|

## Next Actions
1. Draft **Phase 2 Template Expansion Specifications** (Mathematical Derivation Overlays, Observable Parameter Mappings).
2. Begin **Phase 2 Derivation Notes** for key models (Electron, Photon, Gravity).
3. Populate **Cross-Domain Bridges (50.4)** with recursive structure mappings to Cognition, Systems, Chemistry.
4. Develop **Constants ↔ Recursive Construct Modulation Flowcharts**.
5. Create **Recursive Simulation Framework Sketches** illustrating feedback propagation in dynamic systems.
