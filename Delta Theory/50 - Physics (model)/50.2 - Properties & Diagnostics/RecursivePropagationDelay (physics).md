# RecursivePropagationDelay (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **RecursivePropagationDelay** is a **structural property** in ∆‑Theory that represents the **time lag** or **delay** in the propagation of difference (∆) through recursive feedback loops. It quantifies how **recursive embeddings** and **feedback loops** introduce **temporal delays** in the transmission of information or tension across recursive systems. This delay is not due to physical constraints but arises from the **recursive nature of feedback processes**, where each layer of recursive embedding influences the timing of the propagation of difference.

RecursivePropagationDelay governs how **recursive systems** process **feedback loops** over time, ensuring that **energy** or **tension** is distributed through the system in a delayed yet coherent manner. It defines the **temporal characteristics** of recursive propagation, impacting the synchronization and stability of recursive identities.

## Functional Role in ∆‑Theory Scaffold

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Temporal Feedback Modulation|Regulates the **timing** of feedback propagation through recursive systems, ensuring that delays are appropriately accounted for in recursive feedback dynamics.|
|Recursive Delay Amplifier|Amplifies the **lag** between recursive feedback cycles, modulating how fast or slow the system adapts to changes.|
|Synchronization Regulator|Helps synchronize recursive loops by managing **time delays** across layers of recursive embedding.|
|Stability Moderator|Ensures that recursive systems remain **stable** despite **temporal differences** in the propagation of recursive tension and energy.|

## Formal Propagation Delay Expression

Given:

- $∆ᵢ$ — Primitive Difference.
    
- $Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)$ — Recursive Embedding.
    
- $⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))$ — Stabilization loop at depth $n$.
    
- $Dₙ$ — Propagation Delay at recursive level $n$.
    

RecursivePropagationDelay is defined as:

$$
Dₙ = ∑_{i=1}^{n} \left( ∆ᵢ \cdot DelayCoefficientᵢ \right)
$$

Where:

- **DelayCoefficientᵢ** defines the amount of delay at each recursive level.
    
- **Propagation Delay** accumulates as the recursive system introduces **lag** in the transmission of energy or tension.
    
- RecursivePropagationDelay ensures that the **timing** of recursive feedback loops remains coherent and synchronized across multiple layers.

## Interpretive Notes

- **RecursivePropagationDelay** defines how **temporal delays** affect **feedback loops** in recursive systems. It is not merely a function of physical distance but arises from the **recursive nature** of feedback.
    
- **Planck constant (h)** defines the **minimal unit of delay**, ensuring that propagation lag is not continuous but quantized at the **fundamental level**.
    
- **PhaseCoherence** and **ClosureStrength** ensure that the **delays** introduced by recursive loops do not disrupt the **overall system coherence**, keeping the feedback synchronized.
    
- Recursive systems adapt to **delayed feedback** over time, ensuring **stability** and **synchronization** across layers of recursive feedback loops.
