# 50.2 - Properties & Diagnostics (meta)

## Purpose

This section defines the **structural properties and diagnostic metrics** that qualify, regulate, and evaluate recursive dynamics within ∆‑Theory’s **Physics domain**.

Unlike constructs (which define structural mechanisms) or recursive constructs (which define process loops), **Properties** describe **state conditions**, **interaction parameters**, or **dynamic qualifiers** that **modulate recursive propagation, coherence, and stabilization behaviors**.

**Diagnostics** provide **evaluation predicates and metrics** to analyze stability thresholds, propagation coherence, modulation integrity, and dissipation dynamics within recursive embeddings.

## Categories of Properties & Diagnostics

|Category|Description|
|---|---|
|Stabilization Properties|Qualifiers ensuring recursive loop integrity and difference modulation coherence (e.g., [[ClosureStrength]], [[PhaseCoherence]]).|
|Tension & Flow Properties|Properties governing difference potential storage, propagation dynamics, and flux regulation (e.g., [[Delta Theory/50 - Physics (model)/Temp/DeltaTension (physics)]], [[DeltaFluxIntensity]]).|
|Curvature & Modulation Properties|Define recursive embedding deformation and modulation feedback dynamics (e.g., [[CurvatureModulation]], [[ResonanceStabilizationIndex]]).|
|Dissipation & Collapse Diagnostics|Evaluate recursive destabilization thresholds, dissipation flow metrics, and collapse initiation conditions (e.g., [[EntropyGradient]], [[CollapseThreshold (spec)]]).|
|Persistence & Inertia Properties|Qualifiers ensuring recursive structure resistance to modulation drift and destabilization (e.g., [[StructuralInertia (spec)]]).|

## Open Organizational Questions

- Should diagnostic metrics like [[EntropyGradient]] and [[CollapseThreshold (spec)]] be formally layered into **recursive collapse prediction protocols**?
- How can recursive properties like [[PhaseCoherence]] be generalized across Physics, Cognition, and Systems domains while preserving formal integrity?
- Should stabilization properties (e.g., [[ClosureStrength]]) be extended into a **multi-tiered diagnostic hierarchy** reflecting depth-layer propagation integrity?
