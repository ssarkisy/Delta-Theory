# Photon (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **Photon** is a **recursive propagation of difference** (∆) through the **quantum field**, acting as the **carrier of energy** and **information**. In ∆‑Theory, a photon is not just a particle or wave, but the **quantum manifestation of recursive difference** as it **propagates** through recursive embeddings and feedback loops in the field. It represents the **movement of difference** across space-time, where **energy** is the recursive modulation of this difference, and **light** is the observable effect of **this recursive propagation**.

Instead of a discrete particle, the photon is the **differentiation** that occurs in a quantum field, moving and transmitting **difference** through recursive layers. It can be understood as the **outward propagation** of recursive **difference**, structured and modulated by the **quantum field**, and stabilized by recursive feedback loops.

## Functional Role in ∆‑Theory Scaffold

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Difference Carrier|Facilitates the **propagation of difference** through quantum fields, transmitting **recursive modulation** across space.|
|Energy Transmission|Acts as the **energy carrier**, where **energy** is the **recursive modulation** of difference within recursive feedback systems.|
|Information Transmission|**Transfers information** as recursive **difference** propagates, carrying **modulated difference** across recursive embeddings.|
|Phase Coherence Facilitator|Ensures **synchronized propagation** of difference across layers, maintaining **phase coherence** in the recursive field.|

## Formal Photon Expression

Given:

- $∆ᵢ$ — Primitive Difference.
    
- $Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)$ — Recursive Embedding.
    
- $⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))$ — Stabilization loop at depth $n$.
    
- $Pₙ$ — Photon energy at recursive level $n$.
    

Photon energy is defined as:

$$
Pₙ = ∑_{i=1}^{n} \left( ∆ᵢ \cdot EnergyDensityᵢ \cdot PhaseCoherenceᵢ \right)
$$

Where:

- **EnergyDensityᵢ** represents the **amount of energy** at each recursive layer.
    
- **PhaseCoherenceᵢ** ensures that the recursive **difference** remains synchronized across layers.
    
- The photon manifests as **modulated difference** (∆) propagating through the **quantum field**, where **energy** is the recursive modulation of this difference.
