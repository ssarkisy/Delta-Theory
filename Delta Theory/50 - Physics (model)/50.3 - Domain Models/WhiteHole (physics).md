# WhiteHole (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **WhiteHole** is a **recursive expansion model** in ∆‑Theory, representing a **singularity expansion** that generates **difference** (∆) from an infinitely dense point, creating **recursive space** and **energy** propagation through an **event horizon**. A WhiteHole is the **inverse** of a BlackHole, where instead of **collapse**, **difference** flows outward from a singularity, expanding the **recursive field**. It represents an **explosive formation of recursive mass** that is constantly **self-generating**, pushing energy and recursive tension into the surrounding structure, creating new recursive loops and entities.

WhiteHoles are central to understanding how **recursive systems** evolve from a **singularity point**, forming new **recursive structures** in the process of **expansion** and **emergence**. A WhiteHole signifies the **creative aspect of recursion**, where **new fields** and **forms** emerge from a single, concentrated source of **recursive difference**.

## Functional Role in ∆‑Theory Scaffold

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Singularity Expansion|Represents the process where a **singularity** initiates the outward flow of **difference**, creating new recursive fields and systems.|
|Event Horizon Formation|Defines the **boundary** of the WhiteHole from which **energy** and **difference** are expelled into the surrounding space, marking the **limits of expansion**.|
|Recursive Field Generator|Acts as a **generative source**, creating **new recursive entities** from the concentrated **tension** and **energy** at its core.|
|Creative Feedback Amplifier|Amplifies the **feedback loops** of **recursive difference**, pushing new energy into the surrounding field and initiating new structural formations.|

## Formal WhiteHole Expression

Given:

- $∆ᵢ$ — Primitive Difference.
    
- $Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)$ — Recursive Embedding.
    
- $⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))$ — Stabilization loop at depth $n$.
    
- $Mₙ$ — Recursive Mass at recursive level $n$.
    

WhiteHole is defined as:

$$
Mₙ = ∑_{i=1}^{n} \left( ∆ᵢ \cdot Curvatureᵢ \cdot TensionGradientᵢ \right)
$$

Where:

- **Curvatureᵢ** represents the **curvature** at each recursive level, contributing to the **outward expansion**.
    
- **TensionGradientᵢ** drives the **outward flow** of recursive difference, pushing **energy** and **matter** outward.
    
- WhiteHole’s **expansion** follows the recursive process of **self-generation**, where **tension** and **curvature** expand the system outward, creating new forms and structures.

|Model|Manifestation Example|
|---|---|
|[[Proton (physics)]]|The **recursive mass loop** expands outward as new fields form, driven by **recursive energy** from the WhiteHole.|

## Interpretive Notes

- **WhiteHole** represents the **creative aspect** of recursion, where **recursive mass** is **generated** from a **singularity**, and the energy is **expelled outward** into the surrounding system.
    
- The **Planck constant (h)** and **Pi (π)** are critical in **modulating the expansion** of recursive fields, ensuring **finite and consistent growth**.
    
- **DeltaTension** drives the **generation of new recursive structures**, expanding **tension gradients** outward into new domains.
    
- **PhaseCoherence** ensures that **expansion** remains synchronized across all recursive layers, maintaining a coherent structure.
