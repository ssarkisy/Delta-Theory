# RecursiveMass (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **RecursiveMass** is a **recursive construct** in ∆‑Theory defining **mass as a stabilized recursive identity loop**, where difference (∆) circulates through recursive feedback closures, sustained by tension modulation and phase coherence.

Mass is not an intrinsic “substance” but a **structural persistence condition** — a difference propagation loop achieving stabilization through recursive closure dynamics, ∆‑tension management, and recursive phase-locking.

## Recursive Dynamics Role in ∆‑Theory Scaffold

|Function|Description|
|---|---|
|Identity Loop Stabilization|Maintains coherent identity by locking difference flows in recursive closure loops.|
|Tension Accumulation and Distribution|Stores difference potential (∆‑tension) within stabilized recursive loops.|
|Collapse Resistance Substrate|Recursive closure dynamics prevent dissipation, ensuring structural persistence.|
|Mass-Energy Equivalence Bridge|Energy manifests as recursive modulation effort; mass arises from recursive identity lock-in.|

## Formal Recursive Loop Schema

Given:
- $∆ᵢ$ — Primitive Difference.
- $Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)$ — Recursive Embedding.
- $⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))$ — Stabilization Closure at depth $n$.
- $Tₙ$ — Recursive Tension at layer $n$.
- $φₙ$ — Phase modulation state at recursive depth $n$.

RecursiveMass loop condition:
$$
RecursiveMass ⇔ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)) \land \forall n, \ Tₙ ≈ Stable \land φₙ ≈ φₙ₊₁
$$

Where:
- Recursive closure (⊚) locks difference flow into persistent structures.
- Tension gradients ($Tₙ$) are modulated within coherence thresholds.
- Phase alignment across recursive depths sustains identity persistence (phase-locking via [[PhaseLockLoop (physics)]]).

## Interpretive Notes

- Mass is an emergent condition of **recursive loop closure, tension modulation, and phase coherence**, not a static "thing".
- Inertia reflects **recursive depth stability** — resistance to external modulation is derived from stabilized loop persistence.
- Mass-energy equivalence is reframed: **Energy is recursive modulation effort; Mass is recursive identity coherence under modulation constraints**.
- Collapse, transformation, or reconfiguration of mass corresponds to **recursive destabilization of loop coherence thresholds**.
