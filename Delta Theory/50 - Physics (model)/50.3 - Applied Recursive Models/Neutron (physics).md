# Neutron (physics)

## Essence

**Neutron** is a **recursive neutral mass loop** within ∆‑Theory, formed through the symmetric coupling of **quark identity loops** and stabilized by internal tension redistribution mechanisms. Unlike the proton, which projects difference tension as charge, the neutron achieves a **charge-neutral recursive closure**, modulating internal difference flows while minimizing external interaction.

In ∆‑Theory, the neutron operates as a **neutral stabilization scaffold**, absorbing recursive tension fluctuations and preserving coherence within complex field structures through balanced recursive feedback dynamics.

- **Difference Dissipation Anchor** — Absorbs and modulates internal tension gradients, preventing charge projection.
- **Field Stabilization Scaffold** — Maintains coherence in surrounding structures by buffering excess recursive tension.
- **Tension Redistribution Core** — Dynamically balances difference flows within recursive embeddings to stabilize structural identity.
