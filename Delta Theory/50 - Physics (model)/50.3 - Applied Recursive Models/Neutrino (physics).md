# Neutrino (physics)

## Essence

**Neutrino** is a **minimal difference carrier** in ∆‑Theory, functioning as a **tension dissipation loop** that propagates subtle phase drifts across recursive field systems without significant mass or charge anchoring. It embodies the **recursive boundary modulation of difference flows**, redistributing excess tension and fine-tuning field coherence with minimal interactive footprint.

Unlike particles with strong recursive loop anchoring (e.g., electrons, protons), the neutrino operates through **low-tension recursive loops**, enabling phase drift propagation that supports systemic stabilization in dynamic environments.
