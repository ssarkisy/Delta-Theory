# Electron (physics)

## Essence

**Electron** is a **recursive boundary loop structure** within ∆‑Theory, functioning as a **charge propagation carrier** formed through stabilized difference modulation at the periphery of recursive mass loops. It represents a **dynamic modulation scaffold**, projecting difference tension outward, enabling charge and energy transmission across field systems.

Unlike protons and neutrons, which stabilize internal recursive mass loops, the electron operates as a **boundary recursion identity**, modulating difference flow at the interface of recursive structures and external fields.
