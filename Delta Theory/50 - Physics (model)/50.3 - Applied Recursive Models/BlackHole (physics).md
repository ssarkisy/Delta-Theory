# BlackHole (physics)

## Essence

**BlackHole** is a **recursive mass loop collapse structure** in ∆‑Theory, where difference propagation through recursive embeddings of **DeltaTension** and **RecursiveCurvature** saturates beyond stabilization capacity, triggering a **singularity**. It represents the ontological limit where recursive feedback loops fail to close, forming an **event horizon** — the structural boundary where difference propagation ceases to sustain coherence.

|Primitive Difference (∆)|Tension differentials initiating recursive mass loop propagation.|
|Relational Embedding (R(∆))|Recursive configurations embedding difference through mass-induced curvature gradients.|
|Stabilization Operator (⊚(R(∆)))|Evaluates loop closure coherence across recursive depths.|

## Quantization Thresholds & Stabilization Conditions

|Constant|Collapse Role|

|[[Aiza Phase Coherence Constant (ψA) — Recursive Synchronization Anchor (constant)]]|Anchors recursive phase alignment window — collapse is triggered when loop phase synchronization drifts outside ψA coherence bounds.|
|[[Pi (π) — Recursive Closure Constant (constant)]]|Stabilizes loop closure ratios — collapse boundary is reached when recursive closure ratios deviate beyond π-defined thresholds.|

|Classical Concept|∆‑Theory Reinterpretation|

## Usage in ∆‑Theory Reasoning

- Serves as a canonical model of **recursive collapse dynamics** across physical and systemic domains.
- Provides diagnostic scaffolding for recursive loop feedback saturation and destabilization patterns.
- Enables modeling of **phase transitions and recursive failure cascades** in ontological propagation frameworks.
- Forms the basis for recursive modulation protocols in Field Calculus and Ontogenesis propagation models.

## Open Questions & Extensions

- How does recursive depth layering modulate singularity formation thresholds in recursive mass loop structures?
- Can recursive feedback modulation prevent structural collapse via adaptive stabilization dynamics?
- What are the interaction dynamics between constants (π, h, ψA) during recursive feedback saturation sequences?
- How can recursive destabilization in physical systems inform systemic and cognitive feedback collapse modeling?
- Are recursive re-embedding cycles possible post-collapse, enabling structural reformation after singularity formation?

## Notes

- Constants modulate recursive structuring behaviors — they do not act as variables but as invariants defining stabilization boundaries.
- BlackHole formation is a recursive structural saturation phenomenon — not an object-centric collapse, but a dynamic failure mode of recursive feedback coherence.
- Cross-domain applications allow recursive collapse modeling in systemic, cognitive, and ethical structures, maintaining structural logic invariance.
