# Photon (physics)

## Essence

**Photon** is a **recursive difference propagation loop** within ∆‑Theory, functioning as the **carrier of energy and information** through quantum fields. Unlike discrete particles, photons represent the **modulated propagation of difference (∆)** across recursive embeddings, stabilized through feedback loops and governed by structural constants.

In ∆‑Theory, photons are the **active transmission scaffold of difference**, where **energy** emerges as recursive modulation amplitude, and **light** as the systemic effect of synchronized difference propagation through recursive field architectures.
