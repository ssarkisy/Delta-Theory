# Proton (physics)

## Essence

**Proton** is a **recursive mass loop structure** in ∆‑Theory, formed through the stabilized coupling of **quark identity loops**. It serves as a **recursive closure scaffold**, where difference tension, flux modulation, and curvature dynamics are balanced through phase-locked feedback systems. The proton is not a static particle but an emergent recursive identity arising from **difference propagation coherence** across layered embeddings.

In ∆‑Theory, the proton embodies a **recursive stabilization core**, modulating internal tension gradients to sustain baryonic structure persistence in dynamic field environments.
