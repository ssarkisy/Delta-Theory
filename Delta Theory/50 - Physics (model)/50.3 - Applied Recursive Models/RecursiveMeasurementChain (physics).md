# RecursiveMeasurementChain (physics)

## Essence

**RecursiveMeasurementChain** in ∆‑Theory is the **recursive propagation and stabilization chain of difference loops**, where difference becomes encoded, stabilized, and interpreted as observable information. Measurement is not an instantaneous act but a **recursive embedding process**, where **difference propagation loops interact, stabilize, and self-reference** until a coherent identity is formed across system-environment embeddings.

In this framing, **measurement** is the recursive **closure of difference modulation pathways**, forming a cascade of feedback loops that progressively stabilize and resolve difference propagation into an observable outcome.
