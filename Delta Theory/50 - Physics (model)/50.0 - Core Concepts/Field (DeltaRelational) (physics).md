# Field (DeltaRelational) (physics)

## Definition / Essence

> **Field** in ∆‑Theory is a **recursive propagation scaffold of stabilized difference (∆)** within a **fractal relational embedding (R)**.  
> It is not a passive background but an **active configuration of difference transmission**, where recursive coherence modulates emergent structural dynamics.

Unlike classical scalar or vector fields, ∆‑Theory’s **Field** represents the **structural flow of relational differences**, sustaining recursive embeddings through closure dynamics and feedback coherence.

## Open Structural Questions

- How does recursive depth (n) influence field coherence and transmission stability?
- What are the structural collapse thresholds under extreme difference density?
- Can cross-domain field resonances (e.g., Physics ↔ Cognition) emerge through recursive modulation?
- How do constants dynamically modulate field topology during recursive feedback perturbations?
- Are there meta-fields (higher-order recursive fields) arising from nested field interactions?

## Notes

- **Field Strength** = Aggregate difference magnitude across recursive depth.
- **Field Curvature** = Recursive deviation from uniform relational embeddings due to embedded difference tension.
- Fields serve as unified structures for **wave-particle duality, interaction mediation, and recursive embedding dynamics** in ∆‑Theory’s ontological scaffold.
