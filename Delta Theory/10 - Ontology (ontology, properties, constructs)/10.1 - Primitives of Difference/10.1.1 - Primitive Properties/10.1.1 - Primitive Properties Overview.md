# Primitive Properties Overview

This note defines the **core property layer of Primitive Difference (∆)** — a set of **qualifying attributes** that describe ∆’s inherent structural roles in ∆‑Theory.  
These properties are **pre-embedding qualifications** — they exist prior to any relational structuring, stabilization, or dynamic modulation.

## Purpose of Primitive Properties Layer

- **Ontological Grounding** — Establish foundational characteristics of ∆ before it participates in structural embeddings.
- **Functional Constraints & Enablers** — Define what ∆ can (and cannot) do as a primitive.
- **Traceability Backbone** — Ensure that all emergent constructs (Forms, Fields, Chains) are rooted in well-defined primitive properties.
- **Cross-Domain Universality** — These properties apply regardless of domain — physics, cognition, systems, semantics.

## Primitive Properties List

|Property|Description|Note Link|
|---|---|---|
|Irreducibility|∆ is ontologically indivisible and cannot be broken down further.|[[Irreducibility]]|
|Generativity|∆ inherently initiates structural propagation and emergent complexity.|[[Generativity]]|
|Asymmetry|Difference possesses orientation — ∆(A, B) ≠ ∆(B, A).|[[Asymmetry]]|
|NonNumerical|∆ is a qualitative distinction, not inherently a scalar magnitude.|[[NonNumerical]]|
|Recursivity|∆ participates in recursive embeddings, enabling layered structures.|[[Recursivity]]|

## Traceability Schema

|Property|Enabling Construct|Future Spec(s)|Functional Role|
|---|---|---|---|
|[[Irreducibility]]|[[DifferencePropagation]]|IrreducibilityPredicate (spec)|Ensures ontological atomicity; prevents regress|
|[[Generativity]]|[[DifferencePropagation]]|DifferencePropagationPredicate (spec)|Enables structure-forming flows|
|[[Asymmetry]]|[[DifferencePropagation]]|DifferenceOrientationPredicate (spec)|Defines directional flow of difference|
|[[NonNumerical]]|[[DifferencePropagation]]|NumericalMappingPredicate (spec)|Preserves qualitative nature of ∆ prior to embedding|
|[[Recursivity]]|[[RecursiveEmbedding]]|RecursiveEmbeddingChain (spec)|Enables difference to scale into recursive systems|

## Functional Layer Context

Primitive Properties are the **first property layer** in ∆‑Theory’s structural hierarchy.  
Subsequent property layers (e.g., Stability Layer, Energy Layer, Interaction Layer) only apply to **embedded and stabilized difference structures**.  
Primitive Properties apply **before any relational embedding (R(∆)) or stabilization (⊚)** occurs.

## Role in Constructs & Dynamics

- **DifferencePropagation** — Construct that realizes how ∆ propagates through relational embeddings, enabled by Irreducibility, Generativity, Asymmetry, NonNumerical.
- **RecursiveEmbedding** — Construct that scales ∆ into recursive structures, enabled by Recursivity.
- **Future Specs** — Formalize evaluative and operational logic built upon these primitive qualifiers.
