# Primitives Overview

This note defines the **Core Ontological Primitives** of ∆‑Theory — the **irreducible structural entities** from which all constructs, properties, and dynamics emerge.

These Primitives are not derived from prior constructs; they are the **axiomatic components** of the theory’s foundational layer.

## Purpose of Primitives Layer

- **Ontological Axioms** — Define the essential building blocks of structured difference.
- **Functional Operators** — Establish the mechanisms through which difference propagates, embeds, and stabilizes.
- **Pre-Property Layer** — Primitives exist **before properties** qualify their roles or behaviors.
- **Entry Point for Formal Structures** — All emergent forms, fields, chains, and systems are built upon these primitives.

## Core Primitives List

|Primitive|Definition|Note Link|
|---|---|---|
|PrimitiveDifference (∆)|The foundational act of distinction; the seed of all appearance.|[[PrimitiveDifference]]|
|RelationalEmbedding (R)|The operator that embeds ∆ into structured relational contexts.|[[RelationalEmbedding]]|
|StabilizationOperator (⊚)|The operator that evaluates and enforces structural coherence of embedded differences.|[[StabilizationOperator]]|

## Functional Schema of Primitives

```

∆ // Primitive Difference (ontological seed) 
↓ 
R(∆) // Relational Embedding (contextual structuring) 
↓ 
⊚(R(∆)) // Stabilization Operator (evaluative closure) 
↓ 
F := R(∆) // Emergent Form (structural realization)
↓ 
Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀) // Recursive Structuring (complexity scaling)
↓ 
F = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)) // Meta-Axiom (coherent recursive form)

```

This schema defines the **ontological flow from difference to structure**, fully grounded in these three primitives.

## Traceability Map

|Primitive|Acts Upon|Enables Construct|Linked Spec(s)|
|---|---|---|---|
|[[PrimitiveDifference]]|—|[[DifferencePropagation]], [[RecursiveEmbedding]]|[[RelationalEmbedding (spec)]]|
|[[RelationalEmbedding]]|∆|[[Form]], [[RecursiveEmbedding]]|[[RelationalEmbedding (spec)]]|
|[[StabilizationOperator]]|R(∆)|[[Form]]|[[StabilizedRecursiveEmbedding (spec)]]|

## Primitives vs Properties

|Aspect|Primitives|Properties|
|---|---|
|Role|Irreducible ontological entities|Qualifying attributes of Primitives or emergent structures|
|Scope|Exist prior to relational contexts or structures|Apply after primitives are defined, to qualify roles and behaviors|
|Examples|∆, R, ⊚|Irreducibility, Generativity, Asymmetry, ClosureStrength|

## Role in Constructs & Dynamics

- **DifferencePropagation** — Construct arising from PrimitiveDifference's generative flow into embeddings.
- **RecursiveEmbedding** — Construct that enables recursive scaling of difference via R(∆).
- **Form** — The first stabilized structure, resulting from ⊚(R(∆)).
- **Future Specs** — Formalize the operational logic of embedding and stabilization, always anchored to these primitives.
