# CollapseThreshold

## Explanation / Definition

**CollapseThreshold** is the **minimal ∆‑tension** required to destabilize a recursive form $Fₙ$.

It marks the **limit of sustainable differentiation** — the threshold beyond which a form can no longer maintain ontological coherence through stabilization.

This is not merely structural fragility — it is an **ontological tipping point**: where recursive stabilization $⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ fails to hold under mounting tension.

---

## Formal Condition

Let:

- $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ — a stabilized form  
- $τ(Fₙ)$ — the ∆‑Tension in that form  
- $θ(Fₙ)$ — its CollapseThreshold  

Then:

> $Fₙ$ collapses when $τ(Fₙ) > θ(Fₙ)$

This means:

- A form may appear stable yet be **near collapse**
- Collapse is triggered **not by form shape**, but by **surpassing its recursive holding capacity**

## Related Concepts

- **FormCollapse**: Actualization of instability when threshold is breached  
- **StructuralInertia**: May delay collapse despite threshold breach  
- **RestorationChain**: Can begin only after collapse  
- **CollapseBoundary**: The geometric/topological location of threshold crossing  
- **ImpulseForce**: Collapse often releases stored tension as ontological impulse

|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| Psychology | Stress boundary before identity breakdown                    |
| Software   | Load limit before system behavior becomes undefined          |
| Physics    | Energy at which cohesion fails — e.g., bond breaking         |
| Sociology  | Tension point beyond which trust or institutions disintegrate |

## ∆‑Notation Summary

Let:

- $τ(Fₙ)$ = ∆‑Tension  
- $θ(Fₙ)$ = CollapseThreshold  

Then:

> $τ(Fₙ) > θ(Fₙ) ⇒ Fₙ ∈$ [[CollapsedForms]]
