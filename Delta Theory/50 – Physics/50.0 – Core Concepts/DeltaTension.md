# ∆‑Tension

## Explanation / Definition

**∆‑Tension** is the ontological **root of all energetic phenomena** in ∆‑theory. It represents the **stabilized strain** between differentiated states held in relation.

A system exhibits ∆‑tension when it maintains a **nontrivial difference** (`∆`) across its structure, without immediate collapse or resolution.

---

## Core Role

- **Foundation of Potential Energy**: All stored energy arises from ∆‑tension embedded in recursive relations.
- **Prerequisite for Kinetic Energy**: Motion arises when ∆‑tension is released or reconfigured.
- **Driver of Form**: ∆‑tension sustains structure, coherence, and resistance to change.

---

## Primitive Status

- **Ontologically primitive** in ∆‑theory — not reducible to mass, force, or motion.
- Functions as the **invisible coherence** that holds a form together under strain.
- Exists even in stillness, as latent directional asymmetry.

---

## Dependencies

- A structured ∆: a distinction that is **held**, not resolved.
- A relational context: `R(∆)` or nested `Rⁿ(∆₀)` where the difference is **stabilized**.
- No need for time flow: ∆‑tension can exist **outside motion**.

---

## Related Concepts

- [[PotentialEnergy]]: Emerges from latent ∆‑tension in static configuration.
- [[KineticEnergy]]: Releases and transforms ∆‑tension into dynamic change.
- [[StructuralInertia]]: Resistance to transformation due to embedded ∆‑tension.
- [[Collapse]]: Occurs when ∆‑tension exceeds sustainable thresholds.

## Usage

- Explains how **difference becomes energy** without external imposition.
- Basis for describing **storage**, **resistance**, **strain**, and **emergence** in systems.
- Applies across domains: physical (fields, particles), psychological (trauma, repression), informational (latency, compression).

## Expression in ∆-notation

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`.

Then:

> ∆‑Tension(Fₙ) ∝ the degree to which `∆₀` is **held unresolved** through `Rⁿ`.

If the system **contains difference** that is **neither collapsed nor discharged**, it **stores ontological tension** — which may **unfold** as energy or **fail** as collapse.
