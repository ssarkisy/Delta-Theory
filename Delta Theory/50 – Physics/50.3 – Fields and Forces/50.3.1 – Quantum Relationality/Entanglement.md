# Entanglement

## Explanation / Definition

**Entanglement** is the persistence of **relational coherence** between two or more forms across spatial or contextual separation.

In ∆‑theory, it occurs when multiple `Fₙ` forms share or co‑stabilize **a common underlying ∆‑structure** such that:

> Changes in one form **resonate through the shared ∆‑relation**, affecting the other.

## Formal Statement

Let `Fₐ` and `Fᵦ` be two stabilized forms:

> `Fₐ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`  
> `Fᵦ = ⊚(Rᵐ(∆₀))`

If:
> ∃ ∆₀ such that `Rⁿ(∆₀)` and `Rᵐ(∆₀)` remain **co‑stable** under observation

Then:
> `Fₐ` and `Fᵦ` are **entangled**

| Classical QM         | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                              |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Nonlocal correlation | Shared ∆ anchoring across distinct relational paths |
| Instantaneous update | Resonant reconfiguration in shared ∆‑structure      |
| Collapse on measure  | Decoherence of shared R-path through ∆              |

## Requirements

- Shared or linked ∆₀ (primitive difference)
- Persistence of cross‑relational embedding: `Rⁿ(∆₀) ~ Rᵐ(∆₀)`
- System remains **co‑resonant** despite external separation
