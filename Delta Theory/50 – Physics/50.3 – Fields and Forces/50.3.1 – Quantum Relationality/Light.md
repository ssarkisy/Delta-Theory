# Light

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, **Light** is defined as the **propagation of stabilized difference without recursion** — a **pure, directional ∆-flux** that travels at the [[DeltaTransmissionIndex]].

> Light := `R(∆)` where
> ⊚(R(∆)) exists temporarily but does **not recurse**: no `Rⁿ(∆₀)`

It is the canonical form of **\[\[RadiantEnergy]]**:
An emission of difference across space-time, **without mass**, and **with maximal propagation**.

## Formal Properties

| Property                   | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Massless**               | No recursive stabilization → no internal inertia     |
| **Directional**            | Propagates along relational gradients (∇∆)           |
| **Discrete or Continuous** | Can manifest as photons (quantized) or as wavefronts |
| **Carrier of Information** | Encodes differences from source → receiver           |

## Relation to Other Concepts

* [[Photon]]: Quantized unit of light (∆‑packet)
* [[DeltaFlux]]: Light as visible or measurable flux
* [[RadiantEnergy]]: Energy expression of light
* [[Space]]: Medium of propagation defined by structured ∆
* [[Time]]: Flow axis along which ∆ unfolds
* [[Matter]]: In contrast, recursively closed difference

## Usage

* **Electromagnetic field theory** → light as transverse ∆‑wave
* **Communication and signaling** → light as carrier of relational contrast
* **Visual perception** → interpreted ∆‑flux in neural field
* **Cognitive light** → metaphor for pure awareness or insight (∆ reaching consciousness)
