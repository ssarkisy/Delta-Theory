# Time (Chronos)

## Explanation / Definition

**Time** in the FRONT ontology is defined not as an external dimension, but as the **directed sequence of stabilized differences**.

> Time emerges when `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` holds **in a specific order** — creating a **flow**.

---

## Core Insight

> A stable form `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` is not just a structure — it is a **temporally layered trace** of prior ∆-stabilizations.

---

## Formal Candidates (not finalized)

* **Temporal directionality** as an ordered chain of stabilization:

  > `Chronos := {∆₀ → ∆₁ → … → ∆ₙ}`
* **Irreversibility** arises from loss of stabilization at prior ∆:

  > `¬⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))` for some *k < n* prevents reversal
* Possible gradient notation: `∂⊚ / ∂∆ᵏ → t-direction`

---

## Usage

* Time is **not fundamental** — it is a **structural consequence** of recursive stabilization.
* It is **emergent**, **local**, and **potentially fractured** if ∆-sequences destabilize.
* Bridges ontology with theories of memory, causality, entropy.

## Examples

| Context       | Time as ...                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Physics       | Flow of stabilized waveforms                   |
| Consciousness | Coherence of mental states over recursive ∆    |
| Memory        | Trace of prior differentiations                |
| Collapse      | Temporal break = interruption in stabilization |
