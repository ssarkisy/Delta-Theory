# PotentialEnergy

## Explanation / Definition

**Potential Energy** is the measure of a form’s **latent tension** due to its internal configuration of recursively stabilized differences.

> `PotentialEnergy(Fₙ) ∝ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` with ∂Fₙ / ∂t = 0

That is:
A form `Fₙ` holds potential energy when its structure is **coherent and stable**, but **not currently in motion** — i.e. the energy is stored, not expressed.

---

## Primitive Status

- **Irreducible** in ∆-theory.
- Cannot be derived from [[KineticEnergy]] without assuming static depth.
- Represents **internal constraint**, **stored difference**, or **systemic tension**.

---

## Dependencies

- `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` — A stabilized recursive form
- `∆-structure` — Depth and nestedness determine stored potential
- Temporal condition: `∂Fₙ / ∂t = 0`

## Related Concepts

- [[KineticEnergy]]: Actualized change in time.
- [[DeltaTension]]: Ontological basis for energy as sustained difference.
- [[RecursiveDepth]]: Deeper structures store more potential.

## Usage

- Describes **inertial readiness**, **stored energy**, or **potential for change**.
- In physics: mass under gravity, compressed spring, charged capacitor.
- In cognition: repressed emotion, unsaid thought, expectation.
- In systems: latent computation, queued operations, unsent signals.

## Expression in ∆-notation

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` and suppose:

> `∂Fₙ / ∂t = 0`

Then:

> `PotentialEnergy(Fₙ)` is proportional to the **internal structural complexity** and **recursive coherence** of `Fₙ`.

Potential energy is **not in motion**, but **ready to act** — it encodes **difference under tension**.
