# Impulse / Force

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, **Impulse** and **Force** are interpreted not as classical vectors of mass × acceleration or energy change, but as **expressions of directional tension in the difference field**.

They describe how ∆‑structures are **pushed, pulled, or projected** across the ∆‑space through unresolved or propagated difference.

---

## Formal Statement

Let:

* `∆(x)` = distribution of difference over space
* `F(t)` = stabilized difference form over time

Then:

> **Force** is a **∆‑gradient**:
> `Force ∝ ∂∆ / ∂x` — the rate of spatial difference tension

> **Impulse** is the **directed persistence of held difference over time**:
> `Impulse ∝ ∂F / ∂t` — change in stabilized form

## Core Interpretation

| Classical Physics | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                            |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Force             | Tension in ∆‑field yet to be stabilized            |
| Impulse           | Propagated or projected ∆ through structured space |
| Acceleration      | Response of form to net ∆‑gradient                 |
| Newton’s 2nd law  | Stability-shift via external ∆‑flux: `F = ∂∆ / ∂x` |

## Properties

* **Force** = Unstabilized ∆‑pressure acting on a form
* **Impulse** = Time-integrated impact of a ∆‑push
* **Zero force** → full stabilization (∆ absorbed or rerouted)
* **Impulse transfers** ∆ from one stable form to another

## Dependencies

* [[PrimitiveDifference]]
* [[DeltaTension]]
* [[StabilityChain]]
* [[DeltaTransmissionIndex]]
* [[Mass]] — inertia to change = depth of stabilization

---

## Usage

* Explains **motion** as shift in ∆‑embedding
* Models **interaction** as difference gradient rather than external object contact
* Connects to **energy dynamics** via ∆‑flux and stabilization thresholds
