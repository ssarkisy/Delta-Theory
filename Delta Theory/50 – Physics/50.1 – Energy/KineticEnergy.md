# KineticEnergy

## Explanation / Definition

**Kinetic Energy** is the measure of a form’s change **across time**. It reflects the **temporal gradient** of stabilized difference.

> `KineticEnergy ∝ ∂Fₙ / ∂t`

That is:
A form `Fₙ` possesses kinetic energy if its structural configuration `Rⁿ(∆₀)` is **changing over time**.

---

## Primitive Status

- **Irreducible** in ∆-theory.
- Cannot be derived from `[[PotentialEnergy]]` without assuming motion.
- Requires the concept of **time** or **temporal unfolding**.

---

## Dependencies

- `Fₙ` — A stabilized form
- `t` — Temporal axis (implicit or explicit)
- `∂Fₙ / ∂t` — Change of form across time

---

## Related Concepts

- `[[PotentialEnergy]]`: Stored tension within static ∆-structure.
- `[[∆-Tension]]`: Source of both potential and kinetic modes.
- `[[Depth(Fₙ)]]`: Influences how motion unfolds through structure.

## Usage

- Describes **motion**, **unfolding**, **emission**, or **change** of a form.
- In physics: movement of particles, propagation of waves.
- In cognition: shifting attention, transitioning between mental states.
- In systems: data flow, computation, dynamic behavior.

## Expression in ∆-notation

Let `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`.

Then:

> `KineticEnergy(Fₙ) ∝ ∂Fₙ / ∂t`

This defines energy **not as a thing**, but as a **rate of transformation** in stabilized difference over time.
