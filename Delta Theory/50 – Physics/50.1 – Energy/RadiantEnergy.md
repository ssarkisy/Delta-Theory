# RadiantEnergy

## Explanation / Definition

**RadiantEnergy** is energy carried by **freely propagating differences** in the ∆‑field, **without internal stabilization**.

Unlike kinetic energy (which presumes structural form in motion), radiant energy is the **open transmission of pure difference** — unbound, light-like, and massless.

>`RadiantEnergy := ∆‑Flux without recursive stabilization (Fₙ)`
> i.e. `RadiantEnergy ∝ ∂∆ / ∂t` for `F ≠ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`

This includes photons, electromagnetic radiation, and other field-like emissions.

## Formal Criteria

A form `F = R(∆)` expresses **radiant energy** if:

* It is **not recursively stabilized**: no full `Rⁿ(∆₀)` loop
* It is **propagating at or near** the [[DeltaTransmissionIndex]] (max speed)
* It produces **no internal inertia** (i.e. no `[[Mass]]` or resistance)
