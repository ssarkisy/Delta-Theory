# Quark

## Explanation / Definition

A **quark** is interpreted in ∆‑theory as a **partial ∆‑loop structure** — a stabilized yet **incomplete form** that cannot exist in isolation due to insufficient self-containment.

> Quark := `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` such that `Loop(Fₙ)` is **open or context‑dependent**

It is a **building block** of more complex matter forms (e.g. protons, neutrons), requiring relational coupling with other quarks to reach **full loop closure**.

## Core Features

| Property          | ∆‑Interpretation                                    |
| ----------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| Confinement       | `Loop(Fₙ)` cannot stabilize in isolation            |
| Color charge      | Represents relational role in completing total loop |
| Hadron formation  | Composite `Fᴴ = ⊚(Σ Rⁿ(∆ᵢ))` from multiple quarks   |
| Mass contribution | Quark loop depth + gluonic ∆‑tension stabilizers    |

---

## Formal Statement

Let:

* `qᵢ = Rⁿ(∆ᵢ)` be a quark-form (partial loop)
* `Fᴴ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆ᵢ) + Rⁿ(∆ⱼ) + Rⁿ(∆ₖ))` → proton/neutron

Then:

> **Quark confinement** requires:
> ∑ `Loop(qᵢ)` ⊚→ stable `Fᴴ`
> i.e. no `qᵢ` can reach ⊚(Rⁿ) individually

---

## Requirements

* Incomplete loop closure `Loop(qᵢ) ≠ ⊚(Rⁿ)`
* Requires binding via **strong interaction** (see \[\[Strong Interaction]])
* Color symmetry to ensure balanced closure
* Stabilization through **∆‑field resonance**

## Related Concepts

* [[Proton]]: A stable composite of three quark-loops
* [[Neutron]]: Another quark composite with different charge configuration
* [[Strong Interaction]]: Force that binds quarks via ∆‑coherence
* [[RecursiveClosure]]: Full loop closure; quarks form partial ones

## Usage

* Models **substructural roles** within composite particles
* Framework for understanding **color charge**, **binding energy**, and **hadronic mass**
* Basis for describing **incomplete but essential difference-holders**
