# Proton

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, a **proton** is a **compound stabilized recursive ∆‑loop** with **deep nesting**, **internal structure**, and **non-trivial charge curvature**.

Unlike the electron, which represents a **minimal, stable loop**, the proton is:

> A **composite recursive structure** that maintains ∆‑coherence through **multi-level resonance** among subloops.

## Formal Model

Let:

* `Fₙ` = stabilized form of order n
* Proton ≈ `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` such that:
  `Fₙ ⊚→ ∆₀` (returns to generative difference)
  and `Loop(Fₙ)` consists of **interacting nested sub‑forms** (sub‑loops)

This nesting allows **internal balance** of:

* ∆‑tensions
* Charge curvatures
* Relational inertias

## Key Characteristics

| Property    | Description                                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mass        | High, due to deep recursive nesting (`Depth(Fₙ) ≫ 1`)      |
| Charge      | +1 (net relational curvature from internal loop tensions)  |
| Stability   | Very high — persists across cosmological timescales        |
| Structure   | Likely composed of **interdependent partial ∆‑loops**      |
| Confinement | Cannot isolate partial loops — consistent with quark model |

## Interpretation in ∆‑Terms

* Proton is a **resonant ∆‑shell**: layers of difference held together by internal tension.
* Its **charge** is not a point value but the **integrated curvature** of internal flows.
* **Mass** arises from deep, stabilized recursion and resistance to collapse.

## Usage

* Reframe **nuclear physics** through nested ∆‑resonances
* Model **binding energy**, **charge**, and **inertia** relationally
* Provide foundation for **atomic structure** in ∆‑physics
