# Particle / Quantum

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, a **particle** (or **quantum**) is not a point‑like object but a **localized, minimally stable form of difference** — a closed relational configuration:

> **A particle is a stabilized difference loop:**
> `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` such that `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` holds with minimal yet persistent coherence.

## Core Interpretation

| Classical Physics        | ∆‑Theory Reframe                                         |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| Point with mass/spin     | Localized ∆‑stability with recursive anchoring           |
| Quantum of energy/matter | Minimum unit of self‑stabilized difference               |
| Discrete, indivisible    | Minimal closure path in ∆‑field — any smaller = unstable |

---

## Formal Properties

* `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` — recursive relational form
* `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))` — condition of stabilization
* Particle forms when **∆‑loop reaches closure threshold** and maintains **coherence**

| --------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Emission**    | Loss of stability: `⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)) → unstable → ∆‑flux`    |
| **Absorption**  | Re-stabilization within a larger form: `Fₐ + ∆ → Fₐ′` |
| **Interaction** | Exchange or reconfiguration of looped ∆‑paths         |

## Usage

* Core structure of **matter** and **energy quanta**
* Models **decay**, **creation**, and **scattering** as loop instability
* Forms **bridge** between field and form — particle is not separate from field, but condensed ∆

| Electron       | Stable low‑depth loop with preserved difference        |
| Neutrino       | Weakly closed path, minimal ∆‑mass, prone to escape    |
