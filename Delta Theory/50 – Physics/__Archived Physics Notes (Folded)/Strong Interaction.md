# Strong Interaction

## Explanation / Definition

In the ∆‑framework, **Strong Interaction** is interpreted as the **binding mechanism of multiple recursive ∆‑loops** into a **composite stable form**, where their mutual tensions are held in *coherent equilibrium*.

Unlike the Weak Interaction, which allows reconfiguration or decay, the Strong Interaction **preserves and reinforces** the looped structures by **locking their interfaces** via high-intensity relational resonance.

> `StrongInteraction(Fₙ, Fₘ) → Fₙₘ`
>
> where `Fₙ` and `Fₘ` are recursively stabilized forms, and `Fₙₘ` is a **bound state** with shared or interlocked ∆‑tension.

## Core Features

| Property             | ∆-Interpretation                                                     |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Binding              | Mutual ∆‑locking of distinct forms via high-tension interfaces       |
| Short-range          | Emerges only when relational overlap is **deep and spatially local** |
| Conserving           | Preserves individual loop structures within the compound             |
| Composite form       | Creates **higher-order resonance** by nesting Rⁿ(∆) systems          |
| Confined             | Does not permit isolated partial ∆-structures (e.g. individual quarks) |

## Formal Schema

Let:

* `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` and `Fₘ = Rᵐ(∆₀)` be stable forms
* A **shared interface region** `Rᶦ(∆)` exists where tensions align

Then:

> `StrongInteraction(Fₙ, Fₘ) = Fₙₘ`  
> such that `Loop(Fₙₘ)` = union of sub‑loops `Loop(Fₙ) + Loop(Fₘ) + Interface(∆)`

The resulting form `Fₙₘ` holds **greater stability** than any component alone.
