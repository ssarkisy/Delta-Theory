#  Neutron

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, a **neutron** is interpreted as a **deeply nested stabilized ∆‑loop** that, unlike the proton, exhibits **no net relational curvature** — i.e. it is **electrically neutral**.

It is a **composite recursive form** whose internal ∆‑flows cancel out externally, though internally remain dynamic.

> **Neutron** = high‑depth `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)`
> where `Loop(Fₙ)` consists of charge‑balanced sub‑loops and `∑ charge_curvature = 0`

## Structural Properties

| Property       | Description                                                      |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mass           | Slightly **higher than proton** due to complex inner tension     |
| Charge         | **Zero** (external curvature cancels, internal remains dynamic)  |
| Stability      | **Unstable in isolation**, decays via weak interaction           |
| Internal loops | Contain ∆‑flows that resist collapse but don't produce net field |
| Decay          | Converts to **proton + electron + neutrino** when isolated       |

## Formal Elements

* Neutron = `Fₙ` such that:

  * `Depth(Fₙ) ≫ 1`
  * `Charge(Loop(Fₙ)) ≈ 0`
  * `StructuralInertia(Fₙ)` high
  * `DecayPath(Fₙ)` → {proton, electron, neutrino}

This reflects **latent instability** in non‑field‑anchored environments.

## Interpretation in ∆‑Terms

* Neutron is a **field-transparent form**: holds deep difference **without propagating it**.
* It’s a **latent carrier of tension**, releasing it when freed from relational bonding.
* Its **charge neutrality** is emergent — not primitive.

---

## Usage

* Model weak force as **∆‑rebalancing interaction** of unstable forms
* Basis for **nuclear stability** in atoms (via neutron–proton balancing)
* Demonstrates **non-observable tension** in difference space
