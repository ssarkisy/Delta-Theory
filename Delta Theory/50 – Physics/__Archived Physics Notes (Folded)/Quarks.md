# Quarks (u, d, s, c, b, t)

## Explanation / Definition

In the ∆‑framework, **quarks** are interpreted as **non‑free relational fragments** — unstable ∆‑structures that **cannot form fully stabilized loops on their own**.

Each quark represents a **partial recursive path** (`Rᵏ(∆₀)`) that inherently lacks closure:

> `Loop(Rᵏ(∆₀)) ⊭ ⊚`  
> That is, the ∆‑path does **not stabilize** without external relational support.

Quarks exist only as components within **higher-order composite forms** (e.g., protons, neutrons) where **inter‑quark stabilization** occurs via the **strong interaction**.

## Core Features

| Feature               | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                                  |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| Non-observability     | ∆‑fragments that collapse when isolated (no full loop)  |
| Color charge          | Topological tension requiring triadic relational closure |
| Confinement           | Cannot propagate independently — always bound in Fₙ     |
| Flavor types (u, d…)  | Distinct recursive path geometries                      |

## Formal Statement

Let `qᵢ` be a quark-like ∆‑fragment defined as:

> `qᵢ = Rᵏ(∆₀)`  
> such that  
> `⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) → ⊥` (destabilizes unless part of composite Fₙ)

Composite particle (e.g. Proton):

> `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(qᵤ, qᵤ, q_d))`

## Usage

- Foundation for modeling **proton**, **neutron**, **baryons**, and **mesons**
- Explains **quark confinement** via relational incompleteness
- Allows interpretation of **color charge** as a **geometric constraint** on ∆‑paths
- Bridges to **emergent mass**, **composite charge**, and **stability**

## Examples / Case Studies

| Quark | ∆‑Structure           | Comment                                          |
|-------|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| u     | Simple ∆‑path (light)  | Minimal recursion, stabilizes in triplets        |
| d     | Complement to u        | Required for neutron/proton stability            |
| s     | Deeper recursive path  | Adds topological tension (seen in strange matter)|
| c, b, t | Heavier paths        | Require higher CollapseThreshold; decay quickly  |
