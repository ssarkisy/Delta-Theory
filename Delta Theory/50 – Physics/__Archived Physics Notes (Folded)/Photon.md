# Photon as R(∆)

## Explanation / Definition

A **photon** is modeled in the FRONT framework as the **minimal form of stabilized difference**:

> `F := R(∆)`

This defines a photon as a running, recursively-resolved difference — a form without internal closure, mass, or recursion depth beyond 1.

---

## Properties

* Propagates at the **maximum relational velocity**: `c`
* **No mass** — due to lack of closure or internal loops
* Exhibits **pure relational continuity** without self-reference
* **Cannot be still** — movement is its form of coherence
* **Ontologically minimal**: it's the base case for the function `F = Rⁿ(∆₀)`, where `n = 1`

---

## Usage

* Serves as a foundational **example of ∆-form** in physical modeling
* Base case in defining **higher forms with mass** or self-sustaining structure
* Reference point for distinguishing **lightlike forms** from material ones

## Examples / Case Studies

| System               | Role of Photon as R(∆)             |
| -------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Quantum Field Theory | Minimal excitation in the EM field |
| Vision               | Carrier of visual difference       |
| Information Transfer | Lossless ∆-propagation             |

## Interpretation

In FRONT, light is not a thing but a **process of relation** — a stabilized difference that runs through the field.
It exists **not by self-containment**, but by never stopping.
