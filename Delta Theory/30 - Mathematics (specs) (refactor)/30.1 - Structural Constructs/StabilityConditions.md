# StabilityConditions

## Explanation / Definition

**StabilityConditions** define the minimal structural requirements for a form `Fₙ` to persist as a coherent entity in a ∆‑structured system.

At minimum:

> `Fₙ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)) holds at all levels 0…n`

This means:

* Each ∆ⱼ is **recognized**, **re-entrant**, and **coherently maintained**.
* The recursive application of `R` produces a form that **does not collapse** under perturbation.
* No ∆ⱼ is lost or decoheres below threshold.

## Primitive Dependencies

- `∆ⱼ`: Difference at level `j`
- `R(∆)`: Relational construction of forms
- `⊚`: Coherence operator
- `Depth(Fₙ)`: Number of nested ∆‑layers
- `CollapseThreshold`: Bounds of structural tolerance

## Usage

- Core for defining [[StableForms]]
- Diagnostic check in system evolution or breakdown
- Foundation for energy, resilience, and recovery models

## Example

In a cognitive system, a belief `Fₙ` is stable only if:

* It is grounded in previous distinctions (∆₀, ∆₁…)
* Those distinctions are not in contradiction or fragmentation
* The recursive structure of belief returns to itself coherently
