# 30.1 – Structural Constructs

The **Structural Constructs layer** defines the **internal properties of stabilized recursive forms**. While the operators of ∆‑Mathematics explain **how** forms emerge (`F := ⊚(R(∆))`) and evolve (via `Rⁿ(∆₀)`), this module formalizes **what those forms are made of** — and **how they hold together** once stabilized.

These constructs help measure, diagnose, and classify **stabilized difference-structures** (`Fₙ`) in terms of their **inertia**, **coherence**, **resilience**, and **historical retention**.

## 🧱 Core Structural Properties

| Construct              | Meaning |
|------------------------|---------|
| `ClosureStrength(Fₙ)`  | Measures the tightness or fragility of recursive looping |
| `Coherence(Fₙ)`        | Degree of internal alignment among recursive layers |
| `StabilityConditions`  | Formal criteria under which `⊚(Fₙ)` holds or fails |
| `StructuralInertia`    | Resistance to external modulation or collapse |
| `StructuralMemory`     | Persistence of prior recursive embeddings in current form |

These are not standalone operators, but **descriptive diagnostics** of forms after (or during) stabilization.

## Role within ∆‑Mathematics

Structural constructs provide:

- A **middle layer** between pure operator logic (`30.0`) and field/topological behaviors (`30.2`, `30.3`)
- A way to **compare different stabilized forms**
- Criteria for **form identity**, **resilience**, and **degeneration risk**

They enable reasoning about:

- Why some forms **persist** while others collapse  
- Which recursive paths are **more coherent** or **more fragile**
- How much of a form’s present state is **shaped by its ontological history**

## Relationships to Other Modules

| Related Module         | Interaction |
|------------------------|-------------|
| `30.0 – Operators`     | Provides input (`Fₙ`) to be analyzed |
| `30.2 – Field Calculus`| Links `StabilityConditions` with gradients and field modulation |
| `30.3 – ∆‑Topology`    | Influences topological invariants, path coherence |
| `01.2 – Stability Diagnostics` | Conceptually adjacent; Structural Constructs provide persistent diagnostics beyond collapse events |
