# ∆‑Curvature

## Explanation / Definition

**∆‑Curvature** expresses how relational pathways **bend** within a ∆‑field, shaping the **stability, tension, and trajectory** of propagating difference structures.

Rather than measuring physical angles or distances, ∆‑Curvature tracks how **the structure of recursive relations deviates** from linear or neutral propagation. It represents **ontological bending** — a measure of how the ∆‑space itself **conditions the path and fate of difference**.

> High ∆‑Curvature = redirected or reinforced ∆‑resonance Low ∆‑Curvature = smooth, unimpeded propagation

## Formal Intuition

Let `Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a recursive difference path.

Then:

```
∆‑Curvature ∝ ∂²⊚ / ∂space²
```

That is: curvature is the **second-order modulation** of stabilization likelihood across a field.

## Interpretive Properties

|Property|∆‑Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Local Bending|Certain ∆ paths are drawn into loops or collapsed forms|
|Field Tension|Curvature = tension gradient across the field|
|Mass Attractor|Mass-bearing forms generate high ∆‑curvature zones|
|Identity Warping|Curvature reshapes identity trajectories in cognitive systems|

## Relation to Physical Analogues

- In classical physics: curvature of spacetime → gravity
    
- In ∆‑theory: curvature of relational fields → stabilization bias

## Role in FRONT

- Explains why some regions of ∆‑space **foster coherence**
    
- Models **hidden structural attractors** (e.g., [[DarkMatter]])
    
- Enables ontological version of “gravity” as recursive pull
    
- May inform **∆‑geodesics**: least-resistance paths of stable difference

## Usage

- In planned [[Field Calculus]] to model field deformation
    
- As input for [[CollapseThreshold]]: high curvature can trigger breakdown
    
- To detect **resonant attractors** or topological traps
