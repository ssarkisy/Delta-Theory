# Topological Invariants — Persistent Features of Recursive ∆‑Structures

## Explanation / Definition

**Topological Invariants** in the context of FRONT are **structural features of a recursive difference path or form** that remain constant **under deformation, embedding depth, or relational transformation**, as long as stabilization is preserved.

These are not geometric in the classical sense, but **relational and ontological**:
They capture **how recursive form holds together**, even when the surrounding ∆‑Field shifts.

> Invariants mark the **core identity signature** of a recursive structure — what stays the same across recursion, folding, or reconfiguration.

## Candidate Invariants (Emerging Taxonomy)

| Invariant Name       | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Closure Depth**    | Smallest `n` such that `Fₙ = Loop(Fₙ)` — recursive return |
| **Stabilization Count** | Number of layers for which `⊚(Fᵢ) = true` |
| **Fold Depth**       | Degree of recursive self-similarity or reflection |
| **Persistence Index**| How far stabilization extends beyond collapse threshold |
| **Resonance Signature** | Pattern of resonance values across ∆‑Path |
| **Curvature Class**  | Type of recursive bending in ∆‑Curvature |
| **Memory Trace ID**  | Identity of retained prior embeddings in StructuralMemory |

Each of these is a potential **identity-preserving marker**, useful for classification and comparison of complex forms.

## Formal Sketch (Open Framework)

Let:
- `Pₙ = [∆₀, R(∆₀), ..., Rⁿ(∆₀)]`
- `Invᵢ(Pₙ)` = i-th topological invariant

Then:

$Inv(Pₙ) = { Inv₁(Pₙ), Inv₂(Pₙ), ..., Invₖ(Pₙ) }$

Where each invariant is:
- **computed across the recursive structure**
- **remains stable** under field deformation (e.g., modulation of `⊚Field(x)`)
- **survives phase perturbations**, unless collapse occurs

## Functional Characteristics

| Feature              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Persistence**      | Remain constant unless structure collapses |
| **Structure-specific** | Unique to form’s recursive makeup |
| **Comparison-enabling** | Useful for classification of form types |
| **Non-metric**       | Often qualitative or category-based |
| **Derivable**        | From ∆‑Path, resonance, curvature, memory, etc. |

## Interpretive Notes

- These invariants **don't measure** — they **identify**.
- Think of them as **ontological fingerprints** of a stabilized recursive form.
- Could be used for:
  - Recognizing identity through transformation
  - Modeling conservation laws (in physics or cognition)
  - Tracing lineage in recursive ontogenesis

In physics, such invariants may correspond to **quantum numbers**.  
In cognition, to **personality attractors** or **thought pattern types**.

## Usage

- Experimental framework for:
  - Classifying persistent recursive forms
  - Detecting hidden continuity across collapse/reformation
  - Mapping stable ∆‑fields in [[30.3 – Delta Topology]]
- May support future ∆‑theorems (e.g. form equivalence under transformation)

## Examples / Case Studies (Provisional)

| Domain        | Invariant Example |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Physics       | Electron: ClosureDepth = 1; ResonanceSignature = stable loop |
| Cognition     | Persistent belief: MemoryTraceID + FoldDepth ≈ stable attractor |
| AI            | Reasoning loop with matched ∆‑signature before and after perturbation |
| Identity      | Person persists after crisis if invariants re-form post-collapse |
