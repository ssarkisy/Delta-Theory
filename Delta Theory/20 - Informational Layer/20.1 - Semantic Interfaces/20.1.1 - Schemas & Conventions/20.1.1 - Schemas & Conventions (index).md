# 20.1.1 - Schemas & Conventions (index)

> Shared semantic contracts: note types, tags, and formatting rules for consistent Delta Theory documentation.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the foundational schemas and conventions that ensure consistency across all Delta Theory documentation. It establishes:
- Canonical note types and their roles in the system architecture
- Tag taxonomy for organizing and categorizing content
- Asset management conventions for multimedia and supplementary materials
- Formatting standards that maintain dual-register intelligibility

These conventions enable systematic organization, clear navigation, and consistent semantic interpretation across the entire knowledge base.

## Content Structure

| Schema | Description | Key Elements |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| [[types]] | Canonical note types and roles | axiom, theorem, primitive, constant, boundary, modulator, pattern, glossary, index, template |
| [[tags]] | Tag taxonomy and usage guidelines | Layer tags (#layer/translation, #layer/information), status tags (#status/stable), function tags (#function/definition) |
| [[assets]] | Asset management conventions | File naming, organization, and integration standards for multimedia content |

Each schema provides:
- Clear definitions and usage guidelines
- Consistent application across all documentation
- Integration with Delta Theory architectural principles
- Support for dual-register intelligibility

## Key Principles

1. **Architectural Consistency**
   - All note types align with Delta Theory's layered architecture (Translation, Information)
   - Type definitions reflect the theoretical hierarchy (axioms → theorems → primitives → patterns → applications)
   - Schema evolution maintains backward compatibility and theoretical coherence

2. **Semantic Clarity**
   - Each type serves a distinct architectural role that cannot be reduced to others
   - Tag taxonomy enables precise content categorization and discovery
   - Naming conventions support both technical precision and humane understanding

3. **Dual-Register Support**
   - All schemas accommodate both technical and humane interpretations
   - Formatting standards preserve dual-register intelligibility
   - Asset conventions support multimedia bridging between registers
