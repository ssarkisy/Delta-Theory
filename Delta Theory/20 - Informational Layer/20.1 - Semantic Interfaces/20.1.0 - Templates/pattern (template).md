# Pattern (template)

> Template for emergent patterns that arise from successful primitive operations. Microkernel patterns (Form, Flow, Field) focus on mathematical emergence; interface patterns focus on operational tools. Capture emergence, properties, and essential relationships.

---

## LLM Usage Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is template guidance - DO NOT copy instructional text into final files.

### Section Selection by Sublayer:
- **Microkernel patterns** (Form, Flow, Field): Use core sections only - keep concise and focused on mathematical essence
- **Interface patterns** (Buffer, Filter, Router): Use ALL sections including extended operational sections

### Header Instructions:
- **REMOVE** all parenthetical conditions like "(if applicable)" or "(for interface patterns only)"
- **REMOVE** all italic guidance like "*INTERFACE PATTERNS ONLY - Remove this instruction*"
- **INCLUDE** only clean headers without conditional text

### Content Instructions:
- Replace ALL `<placeholder>` text with actual content
- Remove unused sections completely rather than leaving empty
- For interface patterns, populate extended sections with actual operational context
- Maintain mathematical notation and proper linking

### Examples of CORRECT Final Headers:
```markdown
## Pattern Properties          ← CORRECT (clean)
## Domain Mapping             ← CORRECT (clean)
## Pattern Modulation         ← CORRECT (clean)
```

### Examples of INCORRECT Final Headers:
```markdown
## Pattern Properties (if applicable)          ← WRONG (includes condition)
## Implementation Guidelines (for interface patterns only) ← WRONG (includes condition)
*Use this section only for interface patterns* ← WRONG (includes instruction)
```

## Title

`# <PatternName> (pattern)`

> One‑line essence capturing what this pattern is and its emergent role.

---

## Definition

2–4 sentences describing what this pattern is, how it emerges, and its essential characteristics. Include the emergence formula if applicable.

**Emergence Formula:** `Pattern = component1 + component2` (if applicable)

---

## Sublayer-Specific Guidance

### For Microkernel Patterns (#sublayer/microkernel)
- **Nature:** Mathematical results of primitive operations (Form, Flow, Field)
- **Emergence:** Direct from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ sequence
- **Focus:** Essential mathematical relationships and emergence
- **Keep concise:** Avoid extensive implementation details

### For Interface Patterns (#sublayer/interface)
- **Nature:** Applied operational tools for interface coordination
- **Emergence:** From interface theorems and modulator effects
- **Focus:** Operational capabilities and interface coordination
- **Include operational details:** How patterns work in practice

---

## Emergence Derivation

*How this pattern emerges from primitive operations*

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → Pattern` — emergence path from primitives

**Source:** Which primitive operations or combinations generate this pattern
**Prerequisites:** What conditions must exist for pattern emergence
**Formation:** Process by which pattern emerges and stabilizes

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the pattern into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.
