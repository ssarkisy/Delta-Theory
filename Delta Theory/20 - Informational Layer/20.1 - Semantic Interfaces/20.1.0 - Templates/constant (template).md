# Constant (template)

> Template for mathematical invariants that emerge from axioms/theorems. Supports microkernel constants (π, e, φ), interface constants (κ, ι, σ), and coherence constants (r_*, γ_*, δ_*) with sublayer-specific extensions.

---

## LLM Usage Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is template guidance - DO NOT copy instructional text into final files.

### Usage Instructions:
- **Microkernel constants** (π, e, φ): Use core sections + Detailed Mathematical Derivation
- **Interface constants** (κ, ι, σ): Use core sections + extended sections (Architecture Examples, Properties, Implementation)
- **Coherence constants** (r_temporal, r_memory, etc.): Use core sections + coherence sections
- Replace ALL `<placeholder>` text with actual content
- Remove unused sections completely rather than leaving empty
- Maintain mathematical notation and proper linking

### Section Selection by Type:
**Core Sections (All Constants):** Definition → Primitive Derivation → Dual-register mapping → Domain Mapping → Formal identity → Anchor role → Scope & invariance → Instances
**Microkernel Extensions:** + Detailed Mathematical Derivation (proving specific mathematical value)
**Interface/Coherence Extensions:** + Architecture Examples + Mathematical Properties + Implementation Notes + Relationship to Other Principles

### Current Delta Theory Constants:
**Microkernel:** π (Closure Geometry), e (Natural Transformation), φ (Asymmetric Stabilization)
**Interface:** σ_conservation (T4), κ_discrimination (T5), ι_identity (T6)
**Coherence:** r_temporal (T7), r_memory (T9), r_stability (T8), γ_retention (T9), δ_recovery (T8)

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** <Theorem Number> (<Theorem Name>) — "Brief theorem statement"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **<Theorem> Requirement:** What the theorem demands
2. **Mathematical Implication:** What this means mathematically
3. **Constant Emergence:** How the constant emerges as necessity
4. **Invariant Nature:** Why it represents a fundamental constraint

**Traceback:** `A0 → ... → <Theorem> → <constant>` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** How the theorem requirement leads to this constant as mathematical necessity
