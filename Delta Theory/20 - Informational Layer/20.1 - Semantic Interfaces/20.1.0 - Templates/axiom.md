## Statement

- Precise axiom wording (single bullet or short paragraph)

---

## Rationale (context)

- Brief motivation and where it anchors in the theory (do not prove the axiom)

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: <list or “none”>
- Applies to: primitives / embeddings / closure operations

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Immediate consequences this axiom enables (list; keep concise)

- Constants: link to conceptual anchors if relevant (ε, π, e, φ, c)
- Modulators: ∇S / λV / ψA if influenced
