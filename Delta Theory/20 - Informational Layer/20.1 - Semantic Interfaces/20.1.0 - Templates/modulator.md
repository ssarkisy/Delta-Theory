# Modulator (template)

> Use this template for canonical modulators (anchors) such as the SVA triad. Keep notes concise and operational.

## Frontmatter

```

type: modulator
tags:
  - "#layer/translation"   # authoring location for anchors
  - "#status/seed"

polarity: P+|P-|P0  # Required for SVA; Structure=P+, Void=P-, Awareness=P0
aliases:  # Optional

## Title

`# <Symbol> — <Name> (<Axis>)`

> One‑line on what the modulator regulates and at which axis (Structure/Void/Awareness).

---

## Definition

2–4 sentences describing what is modulated (e.g., differentiation, receptivity, phase coherence) and why it matters.

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- Global coupling (if SVA): `$\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$`
- Local effect: note how the modulator shifts a parameter or threshold in a core relation

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- List the conceptual anchors this modulator relies on (from ε, π, e, φ, c)
- Brief “why” per anchor (one line each)

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Structure / Void / Awareness
- Modulates: <what is tuned>
- Enables: <resulting capability>

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Operating window and thresholds
- Couplings with other modulators
- Failure modes (over/under modulation)

---

## Network mapping

Three rows reflect S/V/A perspectives of the same modulator.

| Modulator (axis) | Network construct (Target)     | Interface/API example            |
|------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| <M> (Structure)  | <construct>                    | <API examples>                   |
| <M> (Void)       | <construct>                    | <API examples>                   |
| <M> (Awareness)  | <construct>                    | <API examples>                   |
