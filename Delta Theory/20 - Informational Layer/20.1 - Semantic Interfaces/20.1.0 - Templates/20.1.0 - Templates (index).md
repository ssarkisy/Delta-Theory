# 20.1.0 - Templates (index)

> Reusable note templates for consistent authoring across all Delta Theory components with dual-register support and sublayer-specific guidance.

---

## Module Overview

This module provides comprehensive templates for all Delta Theory component types, ensuring consistency across the entire architecture. Templates are dual-register aware (technical ↔ humane) and include proper derivation tracing back to foundational axioms and primitives where appropriate.

All templates support the complete three-sublayer architecture:
- **Microkernel (00.0):** Core axioms, theorems, constants, boundaries, modulators, primitives, patterns
- **Interface (00.1):** Interface theorems, constants, primitives, patterns
- **Coherence (00.2):** Coherence theorems, constants, primitives, patterns

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Templates |
|----------|-------------|---------------|
| Core Foundation | Foundational truths and derived theorems | [[axiom (template)]], [[theorem (template)]] |
| Mathematical Anchors | Constants, boundaries, and modulators | [[constant (template)]], [[boundary (template)]], [[modulator (template)]] |
| Operational Components | Primitives and emergent patterns | [[primitive (template)]], [[pattern (template)]] |
| Documentation Structure | Index and glossary templates | [[index (template)]], [[glossary (template)]] |

Each template provides:
- Proper frontmatter structure with sublayer support
- Dual-register mapping sections
- Derivation and emergence tracing
- Cross-reference guidelines
- LLM usage instructions for template application

## Implementation Notes

**Template Architecture:**
- **Sublayer Support:** All templates include guidance for microkernel, interface, and coherence sublayers
- **Dual-Register Compliance:** Technical and humane mappings with explicit crosswalks
- **Derivation Tracing:** Proper emergence and derivation documentation from foundational axioms
- **Cross-Reference Network:** Complete linking guidelines for architectural consistency

**Current Component Coverage:**
- **Axioms & Theorems:** A1, T1, T2 (microkernel) + T3, T4, T5 (interface) + T6, T7, T8 (coherence)
- **Constants:** π, e, φ (microkernel) + κ, ι, σ (interface) + r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability, γ_retention, δ_recovery (coherence)
- **Boundaries:** ε, c, Cs (microkernel operational limits)
- **Modulators:** ∇S, λV, ψA (microkernel SVA control parameters)
- **Primitives:** ∆, R(·), ⊚ (structural) + Port, Gate, Surface (interface) + Memory, Phase, Recovery (coherence)
- **Patterns:** Form, Flow, Field (microkernel) + Buffer, Filter, Router (interface) + Synchronization, Persistence, Resilience (coherence)

**Template Usage Guidelines:**
- Remove all LLM instructions from final files
- Ensure proper sublayer tagging (#sublayer/microkernel, #sublayer/interface, #sublayer/coherence)
- Include complete derivation chains where applicable
- Maintain dual-register consistency throughout
- Follow established naming conventions and frontmatter standards
