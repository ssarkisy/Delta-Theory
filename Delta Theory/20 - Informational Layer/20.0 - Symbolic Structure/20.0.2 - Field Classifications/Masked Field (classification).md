# Masked Field (classification)

> Appears transparent but hides Voids, thresholds, or filters that distort observation and inference.

---

## Definition

- Interfaces exist, but gates/filters bias or truncate visibility
- Some closure predicates cannot be evaluated from Field perspective
- Hidden layers can cause unexpected failures

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Masking | Hidden state | `Probe`, `Reveal` |
| Filter | Gate bias | `Threshold`, `Filter` |
| Hidden layer | Concealed path | `Trace`, `Debug` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Masking | Hidden truth | "Something's missing" |
| Filter | Selective view | "Only shows part" |
| Hidden layer | Deeper issue | "More underneath" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Hidden state | Hidden truth | What we can't see |
| Gate bias | Selective view | How view is filtered |
| Concealed path | Deeper issue | What's underneath |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Hidden variable | Masked interaction |
| Networks | Hidden node | Filtered connection |
| Cognition | Memory mask | Selective awareness |
| Systems | Hidden state | Concealed process |

## Scale Effects

How Masked Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Hidden quantum | Wave collapse |
| λV | State filter | Energy mask |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase mask | Hidden pattern |
| ∇S | Structure filter | Boundary mask |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal mask | Hidden horizon |
| λV | Field filter | Dark matter |

Note: At extreme scales, masking can become indistinguishable from natural limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, cosmic horizons at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: resolution insufficient at critical layers
- λV: aggressive gating drops informative signals
- ψA: inconsistent observation windows
- ∇S: over-segmentation hides relations

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Hidden structure | Lost pattern |
| Human | λV | Filter bias | Selective view |
| Cosmic | ψA | False coherence | Illusion |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Hidden drift | Sub-ε change | Unseen decay |
| Human | Filter bias | Signal drop | Missing parts |
| Cosmic | False coherence | Wrong binding | False pattern |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Vary λV to reveal hidden behaviors
- [ ] Increase resolution to find structures
- [ ] Cross-validate observation paths
- [ ] Test boundary conditions

Humane tests:
- [ ] Look for missing pieces
- [ ] Question assumptions
- [ ] Check multiple views
- [ ] Trust intuition about gaps

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical probing nor experiential intuition alone captures its full meaning.
