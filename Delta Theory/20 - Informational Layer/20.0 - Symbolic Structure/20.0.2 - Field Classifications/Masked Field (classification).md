# Masked Field (classification)

> Appears transparent but hides Voids, thresholds, or filters that distort observation and inference.

---

## Definition

- Interfaces exist, but gates/filters bias or truncate visibility
- Some closure predicates cannot be evaluated from Field perspective

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: resolution insufficient at critical layers; sub‑ε drift goes unseen
- λV: aggressive gating drops informative signals

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: over‑segmentation hides cross‑boundary relations
- λV: tuned to mask instability/noise rather than expose it
- ψA: inconsistent observation windows produce false coherence

---

## Failure Modes

- False diagnoses; sudden collapses when hidden layers are engaged

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Vary λV: do hidden behaviors emerge?
- [ ] Increase resolution: do new structures appear?
- [ ] Cross‑validate with independent observation paths
