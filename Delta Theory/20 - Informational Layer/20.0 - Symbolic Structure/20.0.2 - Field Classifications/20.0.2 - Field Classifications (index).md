# 20.0.2 - Field Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes of Field (transparent zone) and interface behavior, tied to anchors and SVA.

---

## Module Overview

Field Classifications provide diagnostic categories for assessing the coherence and interface behavior of Fields based on their contextual transparency and difference propagation properties. These classifications enable systematic evaluation of field quality, identifying interface issues, and predicting information flow behavior.

The classification framework includes:
- **Transparent Field:** Clear interface exposure with unobstructed signal propagation
- **Masked Field:** Hidden interface distortions with concealed voids or gates
- **Saturated Field:** Capacity overload preventing difference discrimination
- **Sparse Field:** Under-resolution with sub-threshold difference detection

## Content Structure

| Class | Description | Key Diagnostic |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| [[Transparent Field (glossary)]] | Clear interface exposure | Signal propagation within bounds |
| [[Masked Field (glossary)]] | Hidden interface distortion | Concealed Voids or gates |
| [[Saturated Field (glossary)]] | Capacity overload | Indistinguishable differences |
| [[Sparse Field (glossary)]] | Under-resolution | Sub-ε differences |

Each classification provides:
- Technical and humane diagnostic criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Interface behavior patterns
- Operational tests
