# 20.0.2 - Field Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes of Field (transparent zone) and interface behavior, tied to anchors and SVA.

---

## Classes

| Class | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Transparent Field (classification)]] | Interfaces expose structure; signals propagate within bounds |
| [[Masked Field (classification)]] | Appears transparent; hides Voids or gates that distort observation |
| [[Saturated Field (classification)]] | Overload/opacity; differences indistinguishable beyond capacity |
| [[Sparse Field (classification)]] | Under‑sampled/under‑resolved; differences fall below ε |
