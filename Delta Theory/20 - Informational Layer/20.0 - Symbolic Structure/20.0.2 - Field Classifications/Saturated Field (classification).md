# Saturated Field (classification)

> Overloaded observation/propagation regime where differences become indistinguishable beyond capacity.

---

## Definition

- Input/throughput exceeds capacity; effective indistinguishability results

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: too many sub‑ε fluctuations accumulate as noise
- c: propagation/processing ceiling exceeded

---

## SVA Coupling

- λV too low → flood; too high → starvation after oscillation
- ψA cannot maintain phase under load

---

## Failure Modes

- Opacity, metric collapse, oscillations, loss of causal trace

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Load vs capacity within bounds?
- [ ] Distinguishability improves when reducing input?
- [ ] Phase/latency jitter within acceptance?
