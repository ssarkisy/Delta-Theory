# Transparent Field (classification)

> Interfaces expose internal structure sufficiently for stabilization and diagnosis; signals propagate within capacity.

---

## Definition

- Observable interfaces; adequate resolution (ε) and capacity (c)
- Closure predicates can be evaluated from Field perspective
- Maintains clarity under bounded perturbation

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Transparency | Signal clarity | `Monitor`, `Probe` |
| Resolution | Detail level | `Measure`, `Sample` |
| Capacity | Throughput | `Load`, `Bandwidth` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Transparency | Clear view | "Can see through" |
| Resolution | Detail clarity | "Sharp focus" |
| Capacity | Flow ease | "Moves freely" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Signal clarity | Clear view | How well we see |
| Detail level | Focus | What we can resolve |
| Throughput | Flow | How much moves |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Signal/noise ratio | Clear observation |
| Networks | Bandwidth check | Clean connection |
| Cognition | Memory clarity | Clear understanding |
| Systems | State visibility | Natural flow |

## Scale Effects

How Transparent Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum clarity | Wave function |
| λV | State visibility | Energy levels |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Pattern clarity | Clear attention |
| ∇S | Structure visibility | Sharp boundaries |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal clarity | Light cone |
| λV | Field visibility | Observable universe |

Note: At extreme scales, transparency faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c) that affect what can be clearly observed.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: instrument/observer resolution ≥ required detail
- c: propagation below ceiling; no systemic overload
- λV: gates tuned to pass signals and reject noise
- ψA: coherent observation windows maintained

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Quantum structure | Wave clarity |
| Human | λV | Gate tuning | Clear boundary |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase binding | Coherent view |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Blur | Sub-ε noise | Lost detail |
| Human | Mask | Gate mistuning | Hidden parts |
| Cosmic | Saturate | Overload | Too much |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Resolution ≥ ε for phenomena of interest
- [ ] Throughput/latency within bounds (c)
- [ ] Gates properly tuned (λV)
- [ ] Phase coherence maintained (ψA)

Humane tests:
- [ ] View feels clear and natural
- [ ] Details are sharp enough
- [ ] Flow feels unobstructed
- [ ] Understanding comes easily

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical metrics nor experiential clarity alone captures its full meaning.
