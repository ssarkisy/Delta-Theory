# Transparent Field (classification)

> Interfaces expose internal structure sufficiently for stabilization and diagnosis; signals propagate within capacity.

---

## Definition

- Observable interfaces; adequate resolution (ε) and capacity (c)
- Closure predicates can be evaluated from Field perspective

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: instrument/observer resolution ≥ required detail
- c: propagation below ceiling; no systemic overload

---

## SVA Coupling

- λV tuned to pass signals and reject noise
- ψA sufficient to maintain coherent observation windows

---

## Failure Modes

- Drifts into Masked or Saturated when load increases or gates mis‑tune

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Resolution ≥ ε for phenomena of interest
- [ ] Throughput/latency within bounds (c)
- [ ] Stable observation under jitter/perturbation
