# Robustness (diagnostic)

> Maintains Form under bounded shocks; no loss of identity or closure.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: shocks remain above/below thresholds without corrupting state
- c: transient load within capacity envelope

---

## SVA Coupling

- λV provides buffering; ψA preserves identity; ∇S avoids brittle over‑segmentation

---

## Failure Modes

- Immediate collapse or fragmentation under small perturbations

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Perturbation tests pass without state loss
- [ ] No hidden layer collapse (audit intermediate k)

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: disturbance rejection
- Chemistry: tolerance to impurities/temperature drift
- Biology: physiological resilience to stressors
- Social/Politics: shock absorption by institutions
- Economy: market microstructure stability
- Networks: fault tolerance under packet loss
- Cognition: persistence of task under distraction
