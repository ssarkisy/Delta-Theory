# Resolution Margin (diagnostic)

> Distance to ε (under‑resolution risk); how much detail can be lost before Form/diagnosis fails.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: minimal actionable difference; margin = signal‑to‑ε buffer

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S raises needed resolution; λV/ψA can compensate via gating/coherence

---

## Failure Modes

- Misclassification as “Zero”; inability to stabilize/diagnose

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Sampling/resolution headroom quantified
- [ ] Adaptive ε per context in place

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: instrument resolution limits
- Chemistry: detection thresholds; assay limits
- Biology: sensor/measurement floor
- Social/Politics: survey granularity; policy signal resolution
- Economy: tick size/minimal price moves
- Networks: logging/metrics fidelity
- Cognition: perceptual thresholds; attention granularity
