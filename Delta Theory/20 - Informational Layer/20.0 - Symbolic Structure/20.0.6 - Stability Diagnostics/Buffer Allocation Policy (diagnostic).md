# Buffer Allocation Policy (diagnostic)

> How capacity headroom is reserved and distributed to absorb variability without entering saturation.

---

## Definition

- Reserve distribution rules
- Headroom sharing plan
- Capacity buffer policy
- Resource slack strategy

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Reserve rule | Buffer policy | `Monitor`, `Rule` |
| Share plan | Resource split | `Check`, `Share` |
| Slack strategy | Space plan | `Test`, `Plan` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Reserve rule | Save wisely | "Plans ahead" |
| Share plan | Fair spread | "Shares well" |
| Slack strategy | Room to move | "Keeps space" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Buffer policy | Save wisely | How reserve works |
| Resource split | Fair spread | How share flows |
| Space plan | Room to move | How slack helps |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Energy store | Force buffer |
| Networks | Queue space | Link room |
| Cognition | Mind space | Think room |
| Systems | Flow buffer | Move space |

## Scale Effects

How Buffer Allocation manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum buffer | Wave room |
| λV | Gate space | State slack |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase room | Pattern space |
| ∇S | Structure slack | Clear buffer |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave space | Light room |
| λV | Field buffer | Space slack |

Note: At extreme scales, buffers face fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, causal space at c).

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: buffer grain
- c: total space
- ψA: phase room
- λV: gate slack

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern space | Wave room |
| Human | λV | Gate buffer | Flow slack |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase slack | Field space |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Space gone | Pattern full | No room |
| Human | Share fail | Flow block | Can't move |
| Cosmic | Room lost | Field full | No space |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Rules clear
- [ ] Share fair
- [ ] Plan works
- [ ] Space kept

Humane tests:
- [ ] Saves well
- [ ] Shares fair
- [ ] Room enough
- [ ] Space clear

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical buffering nor experiential space alone captures its full meaning.
