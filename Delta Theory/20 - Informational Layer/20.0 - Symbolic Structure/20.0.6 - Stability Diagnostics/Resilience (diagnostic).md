# Resilience (diagnostic)

> Time to return near the fixed point (closure) after a disturbance.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: convergence within tolerance
- c: recovery without saturating resources

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA governs re‑lock speed; λV shapes backoff/retry; ∇S influences re‑integration fidelity

---

## Failure Modes

- Slow or no recovery; oscillatory drift

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Recovery time within SLA
- [ ] No overshoot leading to instability

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: damping time constant
- Chemistry: relaxation to equilibrium
- Biology: homeostatic recovery
- Social/Politics: policy rollback/reform latency
- Economy: market mean‑reversion time
- Networks: MTTR; convergence time
- Cognition: time to refocus/regain flow
