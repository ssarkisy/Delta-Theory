# Brittleness (diagnostic)

> Small perturbations cause fragmentation or collapse; stability margins are insufficient.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: residual tolerance too tight; tiny mismatches trigger failure
- ∇S high without ψA/λV support increases brittleness

---

## SVA Coupling

- Over‑differentiation (∇S) + strict gating (λV) + weak coherence (ψA) → brittle regimes

---

## Failure Modes

- Crack‑like propagation of failure; domino fragmentation

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Minor shocks produce outsized effects (non‑linear response)
- [ ] Increase ψA or relax λV reduces failures

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: brittle fracture; glass vs ductile metal
- Chemistry: crystal defects leading to cleavage
- Biology: fragile phenotypes; failure under minor stress
- Social/Politics: institutions collapse under small shocks
- Economy: market flash crashes
- Networks: schemas that break on minor version skew
- Cognition: rigid beliefs snapping under mild contradiction
