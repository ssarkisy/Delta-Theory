# Closure Strength (diagnostic)

> Loop strength of stabilization (⊚): how firmly a Form is held against perturbations.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: residual tolerated within the loop (error budget)
- π: phase/geometric alignment quality across the loop
- ψA: coherence reserve supporting retention
- λV: boundary contract tightness; leak‑rate

---

## SVA Coupling

- Higher ψA and appropriate λV usually increase strength; extreme ∇S can either improve delineation or induce brittleness

---

## Failure Modes

- Slippage (gradual drift), snap (sudden break), leak (boundary breach)

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Residuals within ε across the loop
- [ ] Phase alignment (π) stable under jitter
- [ ] Boundary contracts (λV) enforced; no leaks

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: Q factor / energy loss per cycle
- Chemistry: bond strength; binding affinity
- Biology: synaptic efficacy; homeostatic rigidity
- Social/Politics: institutional binding strength; rule enforceability
- Economy: contract enforceability; stickiness
- Networks: session durability; commit guarantees
- Cognition: memory consolidation strength
