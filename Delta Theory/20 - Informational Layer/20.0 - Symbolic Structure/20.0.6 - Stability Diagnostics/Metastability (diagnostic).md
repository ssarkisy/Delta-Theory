# Metastability (diagnostic)

> Stable within a window; under small drift or perturbation it transitions to a different Form.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: narrow tolerance; slow drift pushes beyond residual bounds
- λV: gates that hold until thresholds cross; hysteresis relevant
- ψA: coherence holds locally but cannot bridge slow changes

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S creates local minima (partial stabilization)
- λV/ψA set the depth and stickiness of the metastable well

---

## Failure Modes

- Sudden transition to alternate Form when boundary crossed

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Identify operating window and slow drift direction
- [ ] Hysteresis present (or absent) and sized appropriately
- [ ] Transition signatures predictable and safe

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: supercooled liquids; magnetic domain flips
- Chemistry: metastable intermediates
- Biology: transient phenotypes; pre‑commitment states
- Social/Politics: fragile coalitions; regime poised to shift
- Economy: temporarily pegged markets; unstable equilibria
- Networks: temporary routing states; pre‑convergence plateaus
- Cognition: unstable habits; intentions that flip under stress
