# Phase Margin (diagnostic)

> ψA coherence reserve; how much phase error can be tolerated before losing lock.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π: phase geometry; margin measured in radians/cycles
- ε: minimal resolvable jitter

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA primary; λV influences input SNR; ∇S can increase phase demands

---

## Failure Modes

- Loss of lock; oscillation; identity drift

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Phase reserve quantified
- [ ] Retention window ≥ recurrence interval

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: control/PLL phase margin
- Chemistry: oscillatory reaction phase tolerance
- Biology: circadian/neuronal phase reserve
- Social/Politics: coordination slack; timing tolerance
- Economy: rollover windows; settlement cutoffs
- Networks: consensus/clock phase margin
- Cognition: attention rhythm tolerance
