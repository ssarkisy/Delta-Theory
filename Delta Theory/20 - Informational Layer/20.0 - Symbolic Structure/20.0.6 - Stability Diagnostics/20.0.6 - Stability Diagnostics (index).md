# 20.0.6 - Stability Diagnostics (index)

> Observational diagnostics of stability and recovery. Tie to anchors (ε, c, π/φ) and SVA (∇S, λV, ψA).

## Diagnostics

| Diagnostic | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Stability Margin (diagnostic)]] | Combined reserve across ε/ψA/λV/c preventing collapse |
| [[Robustness (diagnostic)]] | Tolerates bounded shocks without losing Form |
| [[Resilience (diagnostic)]] | Time to return near fixed point after disturbance |
| [[Metastability (diagnostic)]] | Stable within a window; likely transition under slow drift |
| [[Brittleness (diagnostic)]] | Small perturbations trigger fragmentation/collapse |
| [[Hysteresis (diagnostic)]] | Separate on/off thresholds (λV) prevent thrash |
| [[Basin of Attraction (diagnostic)]] | Region that converges to a Form under ⊚ |
| [[Capacity Margin (diagnostic)]] | Distance to saturation (c) |
| [[Resolution Margin (diagnostic)]] | Distance to ε (under‑resolution risk) |
| [[Phase Margin (diagnostic)]] | ψA coherence reserve |
