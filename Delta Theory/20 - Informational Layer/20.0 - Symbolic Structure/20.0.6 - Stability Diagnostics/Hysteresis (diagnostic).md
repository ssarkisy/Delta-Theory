# Hysteresis (diagnostic)

> Different on/off thresholds to prevent thrash; path‑dependent state.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- λV_on > λV_off (or analogous); gap sized to expected noise

---

## SVA Coupling

- λV primary; ψA stabilizes within bands; ∇S affects needed gap

---

## Failure Modes

- Gap too small → flapping; too large → rigidity/latency

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] On/off thresholds separated appropriately
- [ ] No flapping under expected noise

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: magnetic hysteresis; control deadbands
- Chemistry: adsorption/desorption lag
- Biology: metabolic switches; gene expression thresholds
- Social/Politics: policy flip‑flop control; quorum on/off
- Economy: credit cycles; lending/repayment thresholds
- Networks: circuit breaker open/close levels
- Cognition: habit formation thresholds
