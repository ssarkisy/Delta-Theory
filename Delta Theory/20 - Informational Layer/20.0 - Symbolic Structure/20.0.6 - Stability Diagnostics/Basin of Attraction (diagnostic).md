# Basin of Attraction (diagnostic)

> Region in state‑space from which trajectories converge to a Form under ⊚.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: minimal detectable convergence
- π/φ: geometry/asymmetry shaping basin boundaries

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S sculpts local landscape; λV/ψA shape entry/retention

---

## Failure Modes

- Small basin → frequent escapes; sensitive to noise

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Basin characterized (size/shape)
- [ ] Perturbations remain within basin

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: attractors in dynamical systems
- Chemistry: reaction networks converging to products
- Biology: cell fate decisions; attractor states
- Social/Politics: institutional stability regions
- Economy: macro regimes; policy attractors
- Networks: control surfaces; stable configuration regions
- Cognition: stable concept/behavioral attractors
