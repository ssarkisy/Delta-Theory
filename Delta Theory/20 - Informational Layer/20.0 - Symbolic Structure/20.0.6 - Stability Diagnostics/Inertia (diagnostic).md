# Inertia (diagnostic)

> Resistance to change of Form under intended reconfiguration; minimal “force/time” to shift identity.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: minimal change per step to effect noticeable update
- c: rate limit on safe reconfiguration
- ψA: retention that must be overcome to update

---

## SVA Coupling

- Lower ψA or adjusted λV can reduce inertia; excessive ∇S may increase it (too many rigid distinctions)

---

## Failure Modes

- Over‑inertia → stagnation; under‑inertia → volatility/instability

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Required effort/time to change within bounds
- [ ] No unintended regressions after change

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: mass/inertia; control effort
- Chemistry: activation barriers to structural change
- Biology: phenotypic plasticity vs rigidity
- Social/Politics: reform inertia; institutional lock‑in
- Economy: switching costs; market stickiness
- Networks: migration cost; schema/version inertia
- Cognition: habit change difficulty; learning rate
