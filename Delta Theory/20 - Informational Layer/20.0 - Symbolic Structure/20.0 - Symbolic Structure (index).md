## Module Overview

This module provides the foundational vocabulary and symbolic framework for Delta Theory:
- Defines core terminology and relationships
- Establishes diagnostic classifications
- Maintains semantic consistency
- Bridges technical and experiential understanding

## Implementation Notes

### Authoring Guidelines
- Keep entries concise with Definition, Ontological Role, Comparisons, and Related Terms
- Use aliases for plural/common variants
- Maintain dual-register mapping (technical and humane)
- Include scale effects where relevant

### Ontology vs Diagnostics
- Ontological axes: **Structure**, **Void**, **Awareness** (S/V/A)
- Observational diagnostics: **Form** (observable Structure), **Field** (observable Void), **Awareness** (already operational)
- Use "Cognition" only as a domain instance of Awareness

### Special Considerations
- Maintain consistent terminology across layers
- Preserve dual-register intelligibility
- Support scale-aware manifestation
- Enable clear traceability
