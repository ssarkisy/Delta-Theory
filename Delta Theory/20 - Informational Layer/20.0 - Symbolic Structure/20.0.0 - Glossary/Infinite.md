# Infinite

> In Delta Theory, “infinite” is a limit concept, not a constant. It names unbounded continuation (e.g., recursion depth, measure) rather than a realizable state inside a bounded system.

---

## Definition

- Mathematical limit notion: quantities or processes without finite bound (e.g., $n \to \infty$ in $R^n(\Delta_0)$)
- Conceptual contrast to operational limits set by anchors (ε, c, …)
- Not an object or value; a boundary idealization used for reasoning

---

## Operational Meaning vs Saturation

- Systems are bounded by anchors and capacities. Practically, you observe:
  - Below resolution: “[[Zero]]” (|∆| < ε)
  - Within capacity: distinguishable structure
  - Beyond capacity: saturation/opacity (indistinguishable), not true infinity
- Thus, “infinite” behavior appears as saturation or divergence relative to anchors, not as an attained state

---

## Where it appears in the kernel

- Recursive embedding: $R^n(\Delta_0)$ with unbounded $n$ (theoretical)
- Growth/decay: processes driven by [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)|e]] can diverge in idealized models
- Spectral/series limits: ideal sums/integrals used for analysis

---

## Interactions (anchors and modulators)

- [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]]: sets lower resolution; below → “Zero”
- [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)]]: caps propagation speed; “infinite speed” is disallowed
- [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)]]: high ∇S without support leads to fragmentation, not infinity
- [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]]: too low/high thresholds yield noise/starvation, not infinity
- [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]]: bounded coherence windows prevent infinite binding

---

## Not

- Not a constant or parameter
- Not synonymous with “very large” or “indistinguishable field” (that is saturation)
- Not a physical state reached inside anchored systems

---

## Implications

- Use infinity for proofs/ideal models; translate conclusions back through anchors (ε, c, …) to assess feasibility
- Design stance: manage resolution and capacity to avoid confusing saturation with “infinite complexity”
