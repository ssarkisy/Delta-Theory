# Infinite

> In Delta Theory, "infinite" is a limit concept, not a constant. It names unbounded continuation (e.g., recursion depth, measure) rather than a realizable state inside a bounded system.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Infinite** is a boundary idealization:
- Mathematical limit notion: quantities without finite bound
- Conceptual contrast to operational limits (ε, c)
- Not an object or value; a reasoning tool

Systems are bounded by anchors and capacities, showing:
- Below resolution: "Zero" (|∆| < ε)
- Within capacity: distinguishable structure
- Beyond capacity: saturation/opacity

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Limit | Asymptotic bound | `MAX_VALUE`, `∞` |
| Saturation | Overflow | `Saturate`, `Clip` |
| Capacity | Resource bound | `Limit`, `Quota` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Limit | Beyond reach | "Goes on forever" |
| Saturation | Overwhelm | "Too much to handle" |
| Capacity | Natural bounds | "All we can take" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Asymptote | Horizon | What we can't reach |
| Overflow | Overwhelm | When bounds break |
| Quota | Limit | What contains us |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Singularity | Natural limit |
| Networks | Buffer overflow | Living boundary |
| Cognition | Stack overflow | Mind's edge |
| Systems | Resource exhaustion | Natural capacity |

## Scale Effects

How Infinite manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum infinity | Planck scale |
| λV | State saturation | Energy cutoff |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Coherence limit | Attention span |
| ∇S | Structure bound | Pattern limit |

### Universe Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal horizon | Event horizon |
| λV | Opacity limit | Cosmic bound |

Note: At each scale, "infinite" manifests as a specific form of boundary or saturation relative to that scale's fundamental limits.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Theoretical unbounding |
| Void | Opacity beyond capacity |
| Awareness | Coherence limitation |

"Infinite" appears as saturation or divergence relative to anchors, not as an attained state.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms:

| Term | Distinction | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Infinite | Unbounded limit | Asymptotic growth |
| Zero | Below resolution | Quantum threshold |
| Finite | Within bounds | Measurable value |

---

## Recursive Function

Infinite appears in limit operations:

1. **Recursive embedding**
   $$R^n(\Delta_0) \text{ with } n \to \infty$$

2. **Growth processes**
   $$e^x \text{ divergence in ideal models}$$

3. **Series limits**
   $$\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} \text{ in analysis}$$

---

## Design rationale

This term must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical asymptotes nor experiential overwhelm alone captures its full meaning.
