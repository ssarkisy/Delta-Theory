# Closure

> The stabilization operation (⊚) that evaluates embedded difference for recursive coherence, producing a persistent Form.

---

## Definition

- Operator: `⊚`
- Role: lock feedback loops and boundary conditions so embedded difference persists as structure
- Output: [[Form]]

---

## Ontological Role

- Transforms relationally embedded difference into stable identity
- Mediates between Structure (internal loops) and Void (interfaces/perturbations)
- Requires adequate coherence (phase, alignment, thresholds)
