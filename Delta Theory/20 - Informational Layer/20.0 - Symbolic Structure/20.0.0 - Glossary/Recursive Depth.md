# Recursive Depth (n)

> Depth `n` in $R^n(\Delta_0)$ measures how many embedding layers a difference traverses before stabilization is evaluated.

---

## Definition

- `R(·)` embeds a difference `∆` into relations; `R^n` repeats that act `n` times
- `n` is dimensionless; it indexes contextual layering, not spatial distance

---

## Operational Role

- More depth exposes constraints and interfaces, enabling closure when supported
- Cost/feasibility: required signal strength and coherence typically rise with `n`

---

## Interactions (anchors/modulators)

- [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]]: sets minimal resolvable change per layer
- [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]]: each interface traversed adds gating
- [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]]: needs sufficient memory/phase to span layers
- [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)]]: enables finer stratification if supported

---

## Not

- Not a geometric depth or physical distance
- Not inherently “better”: excessive `n` without support yields dissipation
