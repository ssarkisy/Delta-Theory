# Recurrence Interval

> Minimal timing/window requirements for a pattern to re‑occur and bind across loops; relevant to phase coherence (ψA).

---

## Definition

- The interval over which interactions must repeat to maintain identity/coherence
- Coupled to phase locking, retry/timeouts, and memory budgets

---

## Operational Role

- If the recurrence interval is too long relative to memory/phase, identity drifts
- If sufficiently short and regular, ψA can bind cycles into durable Form

---

## Interactions (anchors/modulators)

- [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]]: primary regulator
- [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]]: sets minimal resolvable phase jitter
- [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)]]: caps synchronization speed
- [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]]: gate behavior can impose retry pacing

---

## Not

- Not calendar time; it’s a system‑relative coherence window
- Not guaranteed periodicity; can be stochastic within coherence bounds
