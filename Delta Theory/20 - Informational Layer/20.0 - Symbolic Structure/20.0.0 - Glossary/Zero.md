# Zero

> In Delta Theory, “Zero” is not numeric 0 or an ontological primitive. It names a difference that is below the current resolution threshold ε — operationally non‑actionable and indistinguishable for a given interface or domain.

---

## Definition

- Zero denotes “no manifested difference” relative to the chosen ε (resolution quantum)
- If |∆| < ε for the relevant interface, it will not pass gates, partitioning, or bind into form
- Zero is context‑dependent: ε differs by domain (e.g., ħ in physics; 1 bit in computing)

---

## Operational Meaning (relative to ε)

- Gate ([[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)|λV]]): sub‑ε signals do not ignite propagation
- Partition ([[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)|∇S]]): sub‑ε variation is ignored in differentiation
- Coherence ([[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)|ψA]]): sub‑ε fluctuations do not affect phase binding
- Closure ([[Stabilization (Closure)|⊚]]): sub‑ε perturbations do not destabilize an established Form

---

## Not

- Not a primitive or constant
- Not numeric 0 in arithmetic
- Not [[Void]] (Void is an opaque outside; Zero is under‑resolution inside a given frame)

---

## Implications

- Choosing ε explicitly per domain prevents category errors
- Stability guidance: maintain noise < ε to preserve Form
- Measurement design: adjust ε to expose or suppress relevant differences
