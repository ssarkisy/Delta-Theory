# Structure (P+)

> **Structure** is the **boundary-forming pattern of difference** — the closure that gives shape to propagation, making it **locally coherent, addressable, and interactable** within a Field.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Structure** is not a material object; it is a **configuration of recursive relations** that establishes **closure** and **boundary conditions** for difference.

A system exhibits Structure when:
- **Closure is present** (feedback loops retain difference)
- **Boundary conditions are explicit** (inside/outside is legible)
- **Modulation patterns persist** (coherence over time)

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Boundary | Interface | `API`, `Protocol` |
| Closure | Loop | `Circuit`, `Cycle` |
| Pattern | Configuration | `Schema`, `Type` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Boundary | Clear edge | "Where it ends" |
| Closure | Complete cycle | "Comes full circle" |
| Pattern | Living form | "Has its shape" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Interface | Edge | Where inside meets outside |
| Circuit | Cycle | How patterns close |
| Schema | Form | What shape holds |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Symmetry group | Natural pattern |
| Networks | API schema | Clear interface |
| Cognition | Mental model | Felt shape |
| Systems | Protocol | Living form |

## Scale Effects

How Structure manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum structure | Wave function |
| λV | Interface granularity | Discrete states |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Pattern coherence | Stable form |
| ∇S | Boundary clarity | Clear shape |

### Universe Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal structure | Cosmic web |
| λV | Pattern horizon | Galaxy clusters |

Note: At extreme scales, Structure may blur into Field-like or Void-like presentations due to fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, cosmic horizons at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Defines closure and boundary |
| Void | Receives structural projection |
| Awareness | Stabilizes persistence |

Structure provides the **conditions for Form** to arise and persist within a receptive Field.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms:

| Term | Distinction | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Structure | Closure pattern | API schema |
| Field | Access zone | Observable system |
| Void | Hidden zone | Black box |

---

## Recursive Function

Structure emerges through closure:

$$
F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0)) \quad \text{as structural closure}
$$

Structure participates in the loop:

$$
\text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Void} \rightarrow \text{Awareness} \rightarrow \text{Structure}'
$$

---

## Design rationale

This term must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical patterns nor experiential forms alone captures its full meaning.
