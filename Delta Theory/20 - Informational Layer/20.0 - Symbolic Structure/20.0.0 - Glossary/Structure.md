# Structure

> **Structure** is the **boundary-forming pattern of difference** — the closure that gives shape to propagation, making it **locally coherent, addressable, and interactable** within a Field.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Structure** is not a material object; it is a **configuration of recursive relations** that establishes **closure** and **boundary conditions** for difference. Structure is the shape of stabilization: where recursive feedback retains form and delineates an inside from an outside.

A system exhibits Structure when:
- **Closure is present** (feedback loops retain difference)
- **Boundary conditions are explicit** (what is inside/outside is legible)
- **Modulation patterns persist** (coherence is sustained over time)

Structure is thus a property of recursion that becomes **visible in a [[Field]]** and **projected into a [[Void]]**.

## Ontological Role

| Domain     | Role                                                |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| Structure  | Defines closure and boundary; shapes Forms          |
| [[Void]]       | Receives structural projection and perturbs it      |
| Awareness  | Tunes coherence; stabilizes structural persistence  |

Structure provides the **conditions for Form** to arise and persist within a receptive Field.

## Structure vs Field vs Void

| Term        | Boundary          | Description                                                     |
|-------------|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Structure** | **Closure-defined** | Patterned relations that impose shape and boundary on difference |
| **[[Field]]**     | **Transparent**     | Recursively structured zone where internal loops are accessible  |
| **[[Void]]**      | **Opaque**          | External relational outside with hidden internal recursion       |

> A Field is where Structure becomes **accessible**; a Void is where Structure is **inaccessible**.

## Recursive Function

Structure emerges where recursive embedding resolves into stable boundary conditions:

$$
F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0)) \quad \text{as structural closure within a transparent Field}
$$

- $R^n(∆_0)$ — nth-level recursive embedding of difference
- $⊚$ — stabilization operator (feedback, retention, closure)

Structure participates in the recursive loop:

$$
\text{Structure} \rightarrow \text{Void} \rightarrow \text{Awareness} \rightarrow \text{Structure}'
$$
