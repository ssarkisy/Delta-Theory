# Active Polarity (P+)

> The structure-building pole in a [[Polarity (glossary)]] system that represents difference intake, self-contained forms, and autonomous structure generation through satisfied differential states.

## Definition

Active Polarity (P+) represents the structure-building, self-contained aspect of a polarity system that operates from differential satiety to create autonomous forms. It emerges from [[PrimitiveDifference|∆]] through relational embedding and manifests when systems have sufficient difference accumulation to build internal structure rather than seek external resources. Contains P-(n+1) at its core through nested counter-rotation.

**Note on Energy-Difference Relationship:** In domain-specific manifestations, accumulated differences appear as various forms of energy (potential, kinetic, chemical, etc.). Energy is thus a domain projection of the more fundamental ∆ substrate—the capacity to make differences manifest as measurable work or transformation potential.
