# Active Polarity (P-)

> The field-seeking pole in a polarity system that represents difference outflow, connection-making, and external resource acquisition through differential need states.

## Definition

Active Polarity (P-) represents the field-seeking, connection-making aspect of a polarity system that operates from differential need to establish pathways and flows. It emerges through relational embedding and manifests when systems require external resources, creating channels and frameworks for difference acquisition. Contains P+(n+1) at its core through nested counter-rotation.

## Scale Effects

How Active Polarity manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Minimum stable patterns create quantum containment
- **Example:** Binding energies and quantum state stability

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Pattern recognition enables stable framework formation
- **Example:** Institutional structures and organizational frameworks

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Large-scale structure formation through gravitational frameworks
- **Example:** Galactic filaments and cosmic web architecture

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, active polarity may present as its polarity opposites due to fundamental limits.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Provides stable frameworks and pathways |
| Void | Creates connection channels and resource flows |
| Awareness | Maintains coherent organizational patterns |

Active Polarity is the **framework-building** dimension of the triadic system, establishing stable pathways for difference flow.
