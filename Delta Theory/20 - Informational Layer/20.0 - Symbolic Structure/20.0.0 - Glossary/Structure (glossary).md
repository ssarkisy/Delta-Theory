# Structure (P+)

> **Structure** is the **boundary-forming pattern of difference** — the closure that gives shape to propagation, making it **locally coherent, addressable, and interactable** within a Field.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Structure** is not a material object; it is a **configuration of recursive relations** that establishes **closure** and **boundary conditions** for difference.

A system exhibits Structure when:
- **Closure is present** (feedback loops retain difference)
- **Boundary conditions are explicit** (inside/outside is legible)
- **Modulation patterns persist** (coherence over time)

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Boundary | Interface | `API`, `Protocol` |
| Closure | Loop | `Circuit`, `Cycle` |
| Pattern | Configuration | `Schema`, `Type` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Boundary | Clear edge | "Where it ends" |
| Closure | Complete cycle | "Comes full circle" |
| Pattern | Living form | "Has its shape" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Interface | Edge | Where inside meets outside |
| Circuit | Cycle | How patterns close |
| Schema | Form | What shape holds |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Symmetry group | Natural pattern |
| Networks | API schema | Clear interface |
| Cognition | Mental model | Felt shape |
| Systems | Protocol | Living form |

## Scale Effects

How Structure manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum uncertainty creates discrete structural states
- **Example:** Wave function collapse and particle boundary formation

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention spans define recognizable structural patterns
- **Example:** Stable forms and clear organizational boundaries

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed limits create structural horizons
- **Example:** Cosmic web architecture and galactic cluster organization

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, Structure may blur into Field-like or Void-like presentations due to fundamental limits (quantum uncertainty at ε, cosmic horizons at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Defines closure and boundary |
| Void | Receives structural projection |
| Awareness | Stabilizes persistence |

Structure provides the **conditions for Form** to arise and persist within a receptive Field.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Structure | Field | Structure provides form; Field provides access |
| Structure | Void | Structure has boundaries; Void is opaque |
| Structure | Awareness | Structure creates patterns; Awareness maintains coherence |
