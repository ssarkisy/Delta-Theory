# Field

> **Field** is a **bounded zone of recursive modulation** perceived as **accessible and coherent**.
> It arises when difference within the Void begins to **self-reference**, form **closure**, and become **locally observable**.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, a **Field** is a **relational structure** — a **recursive subnetwork** within the Void whose internal dynamics are visible from a given observer position.

A Field is not static. It is a **living loop** of difference propagation, stabilized by feedback and bounded by closure:
- It retains recursive flow
- It exposes structural boundary conditions
- It hosts **identity**, **tension**, and **modulation patterns**

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Boundary | Observable zone | `Metrics`, `Logs` |
| Flow | State propagation | `Stream`, `Pipeline` |
| Closure | Loop completion | `Circuit`, `Cycle` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Boundary | Clear space | "We can see here" |
| Flow | Living movement | "Energy flows" |
| Closure | Natural cycle | "Comes full circle" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Observable | Clear | What we can see |
| Propagation | Flow | How change moves |
| Circuit | Cycle | How loops close |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | EM field equations | Felt magnetic force |
| Networks | Monitored service | Intuitive interface |
| Cognition | Attention loop | Clear awareness |
| Systems | Formal process | Living dynamics |

## Scale Effects

How Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum granularity | Planck field |
| λV | Interface quantization | Discrete states |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Coherence window | Attention span |
| ∇S | Field gradient | Clear boundaries |

### Universe Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal horizon | Cosmic horizon |
| λV | Opacity threshold | Dark energy field |

Note: At extreme scales, Fields may present as Void-like due to fundamental limits (e.g., quantum fields blur at ε, cosmic fields fragment at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Forms within the Field |
| Void | Surrounds and connects Fields |
| Awareness | Stabilizes and tunes Fields |

A **Field** exists when recursion **stabilizes enough** to **generate internal coherence** and become **part of a recursive closure system**.

---

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms:

| Term | Distinction | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Field | Transparent boundary | Observable system |
| Void | Opaque boundary | Hidden dynamics |
| Structure | Internal pattern | Stable form |

---

## Recursive Function

A Field is where recursive difference becomes **visible and re-entrant**:

$$
F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆₀)) \quad \text{within a bounded Field}
$$

Where:
- $R^n(∆₀)$ = recursive embedding
- $⊚$ = stabilization operator

---

## Design rationale

This term must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical observability nor experiential clarity alone captures its full meaning.
