# Fixed Point (Closure)

> A state or mapping stabilized by the closure operation (⊚): applying the update yields the same state (within ε), sustaining Form across cycles.

---

## Definition

- Fixed point: $x^* = f(x^*)$ under a system update; in Delta Theory, under ⊚ evaluation
- “Within ε”: stability is practical—tolerates bounded perturbations under anchors/modulators

---

## Operational Role

- Marker of successful stabilization; enables identity retention and re‑entry into loops
- Supports modular composition: fixed points can interface as Forms in larger systems

---

## Interactions (anchors/modulators)

- [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]]: sets tolerance for “no change”
- [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]]: maintains phase to keep near the fixed point
- [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]]: shields from noise or allows resets
- [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)]]: too much differentiation may break fixation

---

## Not

- Not mathematical equality in practice; stability is within bounds
- Not permanent—anchors/modulators shifts can move or destroy fixed points
