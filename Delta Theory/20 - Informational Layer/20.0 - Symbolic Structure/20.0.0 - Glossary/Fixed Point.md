# Fixed Point (Closure)

> A state or mapping stabilized by the closure operation (⊚): applying the update yields the same state (within ε), sustaining Form across cycles.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, a **Fixed Point** is a state that remains unchanged (within ε) under the closure operation:
- Mathematical form: $x^* = f(x^*)$ under system update
- Stability is practical—tolerates bounded perturbations
- Enables identity retention and re-entry into loops

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Stability | State invariant | `Cache`, `Memo` |
| Tolerance | Error bounds | `Threshold`, `Epsilon` |
| Re-entry | Loop stability | `Cycle`, `Iterator` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Stability | Natural balance | "Found its place" |
| Tolerance | Flexibility | "Close enough" |
| Re-entry | Rhythm | "Comes back around" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Invariant | Balance | What stays stable |
| Threshold | Flexibility | How much change allowed |
| Cycle | Rhythm | How patterns repeat |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Equilibrium state | Natural balance |
| Networks | Cache stability | Living memory |
| Cognition | Working memory | Clear pattern |
| Systems | Protocol state | Stable rhythm |

## Scale Effects

How Fixed Point manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum stability | Ground state |
| λV | State discreteness | Energy level |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Pattern stability | Stable memory |
| ∇S | Form clarity | Clear shape |

### Universe Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal stability | Cosmic structure |
| λV | Phase lock | Galaxy formation |

Note: At extreme scales, Fixed Points face fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c) that affect how stability can be maintained.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Enables stable Forms |
| Void | Resists perturbation |
| Awareness | Maintains identity |

Fixed points are markers of successful stabilization, enabling identity retention and modular composition.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms:

| Term | Distinction | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| Fixed Point | Stable state | Cache hit |
| Closure | Operation | State update |
| Form | Result | Stable pattern |

---

## Recursive Function

Fixed points emerge when closure stabilizes:

$$
x^* = ⊚(x^*) \quad \text{within } ε
$$

Where:
- $x^*$ = fixed point state
- ⊚ = closure operator
- ε = stability tolerance

---

## Design rationale

This term must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical invariants nor experiential balance alone captures its full meaning.
