# Recurrence Interval

> Minimal timing/window requirements for a pattern to re‑occur and bind across loops; relevant to phase coherence (ψA).

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, a **Recurrence Interval** is:
- The period over which interactions must repeat
- Required window for maintaining identity/coherence
- Coupled to phase locking and memory budgets

Key aspects:
- Must be short enough for ψA to bind cycles
- Can vary within coherence bounds
- System-relative, not absolute time

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Window | Time bound | `Timeout`, `TTL` |
| Repeat | Cycle check | `HeartBeat`, `Ping` |
| Memory | State retention | `Cache`, `Buffer` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Window | Natural rhythm | "Right timing" |
| Repeat | Regular return | "Comes back" |
| Memory | Living history | "Still remember" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Timeout | Window | When patterns must return |
| Cycle | Rhythm | How time flows |
| Retention | Memory | What stays with us |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Oscillation period | Natural rhythm |
| Networks | Heartbeat interval | Living connection |
| Cognition | Memory refresh | Present moment |
| Systems | Update cycle | Organic timing |

## Scale Effects

How Recurrence Interval manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum periods set minimum recurrence times
- **Example:** Wave function oscillations and particle decay lifetimes

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention spans define pattern recognition windows
- **Example:** Memory refresh cycles and conscious rhythm perception

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed limits create maximum recurrence horizons
- **Example:** Galactic rotation periods and cosmic structure cycles

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, Recurrence Intervals face fundamental limits (quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c) affecting pattern stability maintenance.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Sets pattern timing |
| Void | Imposes retry windows |
| Awareness | Enables coherence |

If the interval is too long relative to memory/phase, identity drifts.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Recurrence Interval | Fixed Point | Recurrence Interval is temporal; Fixed Point is stable state |
| Recurrence Interval | Recursive Depth | Recurrence Interval is timing; Recursive Depth is nesting |
| Recurrence Interval | Awareness | Recurrence Interval sets timing; Awareness maintains coherence |
