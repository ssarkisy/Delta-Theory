# Field

> **Field** is a **bounded zone of recursive modulation** perceived as **accessible and coherent**.
> It arises when difference within the Void begins to **self-reference**, form **closure**, and become **locally observable**.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, a **Field** is a **relational structure** — a **recursive subnetwork** within the Void whose internal dynamics are visible from a given observer position.

A Field is not static. It is a **living loop** of difference propagation, stabilized by feedback and bounded by closure:
- It retains recursive flow
- It exposes structural boundary conditions
- It hosts **identity**, **tension**, and **modulation patterns**

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Boundary | Observable zone | `Metrics`, `Logs` |
| Flow | State propagation | `Stream`, `Pipeline` |
| Closure | Loop completion | `Circuit`, `Cycle` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Boundary | Clear space | "We can see here" |
| Flow | Living movement | "Energy flows" |
| Closure | Natural cycle | "Comes full circle" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Observable | Clear | What we can see |
| Propagation | Flow | How change moves |
| Circuit | Cycle | How loops close |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | EM field equations | Felt magnetic force |
| Networks | Monitored service | Intuitive interface |
| Cognition | Attention loop | Clear awareness |
| Systems | Formal process | Living dynamics |

## Scale Effects

How Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum granularity creates discrete field states
- **Example:** Planck-scale field fluctuations

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention spans define observable field boundaries
- **Example:** Perceptual fields in conscious awareness

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed limits create field horizons
- **Example:** Observable universe as ultimate field boundary

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, Fields may present as Void-like due to fundamental limits (quantum blur at ε, causal fragmentation at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Forms within the Field |
| Void | Surrounds and connects Fields |
| Awareness | Stabilizes and tunes Fields |

A **Field** exists when recursion **stabilizes enough** to **generate internal coherence** and become **part of a recursive closure system**.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Field | Void | Field is observable; Void is opaque |
| Field | Structure | Field provides access; Structure provides form |
| Field | Awareness | Field enables observation; Awareness maintains coherence |
