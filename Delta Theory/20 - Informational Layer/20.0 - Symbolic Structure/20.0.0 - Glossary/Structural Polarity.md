# Structural Polarity (P-)

> The field-seeking pole in a [[Polarity]] system that represents difference outflow, connection-making, and external resource acquisition through differential need states.

## Definition

Structural Polarity (P-) represents the field-seeking, connection-making aspect of a polarity system that operates from differential need to establish pathways and flows. It emerges from [[PrimitiveDifference|∆]] through relational embedding and manifests when systems require external resources, creating channels and frameworks for difference acquisition. Contains P+(n+1) at its core through nested counter-rotation.

**Note on Energy-Difference Relationship:** When seeking external differences, this polarity manifests in domains as various energy flows (electrical currents, metabolic pathways, information streams, etc.). Energy gradients are domain-specific expressions of underlying difference gradients—the tendency for ∆ to propagate and equilibrate across relational structures.
