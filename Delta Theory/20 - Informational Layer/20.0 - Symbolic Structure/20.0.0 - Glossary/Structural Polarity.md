# Structural Polarity (P⁻)

> The stabilizing pole in a [[Polarity]] system that maintains patterns, provides framework, and enables coherent absorption of difference through structured containment.

## Definition

Structural Polarity (P⁻) represents the stabilizing, pattern-maintaining aspect of a polarity system that provides framework and coherence. It emerges from [[PrimitiveDifference|∆]] through relational embedding and maintains difference's stability through structured containment. Contains P⁺ₙ₊₁ at its core through nested counter-rotation.
