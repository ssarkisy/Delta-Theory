# 20.0.0 - Glossary (meta)

> Canonical concept definitions with dual-register mapping and recursive examples.
> Each term maintains both technical precision and humane understanding.

## Scope

Document core terms that:
1. Define derived concepts
2. Bridge technical and humane registers
3. Show recursive manifestations
4. Support formal expression

Note: Primitives are defined in [[00.0.0 - Virtual Substrate — Kernel Primitives (index)]].
