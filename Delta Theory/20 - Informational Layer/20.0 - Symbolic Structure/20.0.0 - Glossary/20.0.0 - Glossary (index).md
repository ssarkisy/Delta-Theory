# 20.0.0 - Glossary (index)

> Canonical concept definitions with dual-register mapping and recursive examples.

---

## Module Overview

The Glossary provides stable definitions for all derived concepts in Delta Theory, maintaining both technical precision and humane understanding while showing recursive manifestations across scales. It establishes:
- Core terminology with dual-register intelligibility
- Scale-aware definitions that work across micro, human, and cosmic boundaries
- Formal expression support for implementation contexts
- Bridge mappings between technical and experiential understanding

Note: Core primitives are defined in [[00.0 - Microkernel (index)]]. **Polarity** is included as the organizing framework for the triadic structure.

## Key Principles

1. **Dual-Register Intelligibility**
   - All terms maintain both technical (network/computational) and humane (biological/relational) interpretations
   - Crosswalk mappings bridge technical and experiential understanding
   - Scale effects manifest differently across micro, human, and cosmic boundaries

2. **Scale-Aware Definitions**
   - Terms work consistently across micro (ε-bounded), human (ψA-bounded), and cosmic (c-bounded) scales
   - Scale transitions may present polarity opposites due to fundamental limits
   - Recursive manifestations demonstrate consistent principles across scales

3. **Theoretical Grounding**
   - All glossary terms derive from Translation Layer foundations (∆, R(·), ⊚, SVA modulators)
   - Definitions maintain consistency with axioms, theorems, and primitive operations
   - Formal expressions support mathematical implementation and verification

4. **Polarity Organization**
   - Triadic structure (Structure-Void-Awareness) organizes all conceptual relationships
   - Polarity framework provides systematic classification and relationship mapping
   - Modulation patterns (∇S, λV, ψA) govern dynamic interactions between concepts
