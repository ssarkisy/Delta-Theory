# Relation (R(·))

> Operational dimension of Delta Theory: the act of embedding a difference into relations (context/graph) so that stabilization can be evaluated.

---

## Definition

- R(·) maps ∆ into a network of distinctions (contexts, paths, boundaries)
- Provides the conditions and thresholds that [[Stabilization (Closure)]] evaluates
- Depth `n` in $R^n(∆_0)$ expresses recursive embedding layers

---

## Ontological Role

- Positions Structure within a Void‑facing graph
- Shapes feasible closures, interfaces, and modulators’ operating windows
- Serves as the “operational dimension” (not geometric) along which coherence is organized
