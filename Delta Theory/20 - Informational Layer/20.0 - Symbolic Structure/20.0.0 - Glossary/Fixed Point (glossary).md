# Fixed Point (Closure)

> A state or mapping stabilized by the closure operation (⊚): applying the update yields the same state (within ε), sustaining Form across cycles.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, a **Fixed Point** is a state that remains unchanged (within ε) under the closure operation:
- Mathematical form: $x^* = f(x^*)$ under system update
- Stability is practical—tolerates bounded perturbations
- Enables identity retention and re-entry into loops

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Stability | State invariant | `Cache`, `Memo` |
| Tolerance | Error bounds | `Threshold`, `Epsilon` |
| Re-entry | Loop stability | `Cycle`, `Iterator` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Stability | Natural balance | "Found its place" |
| Tolerance | Flexibility | "Close enough" |
| Re-entry | Rhythm | "Comes back around" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Invariant | Balance | What stays stable |
| Threshold | Flexibility | How much change allowed |
| Cycle | Rhythm | How patterns repeat |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Equilibrium state | Natural balance |
| Networks | Cache stability | Living memory |
| Cognition | Working memory | Clear pattern |
| Systems | Protocol state | Stable rhythm |

## Scale Effects

How Fixed Point manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum uncertainty limits absolute stability
- **Example:** Ground state energy levels with quantum fluctuations

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Pattern stability within attention spans
- **Example:** Stable memories and recognizable forms

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Large-scale structures maintain stability across cosmic time
- **Example:** Galaxy formations and cosmic web structures

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, Fixed Points face fundamental limits (quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c) that affect stability maintenance.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Enables stable Forms |
| Void | Resists perturbation |
| Awareness | Maintains identity |

Fixed points are markers of successful stabilization, enabling identity retention and modular composition.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Fixed Point | Closure | Fixed Point is stable state; Closure is the operation |
| Fixed Point | Form | Fixed Point maintains stability; Form provides structure |
| Fixed Point | Recurrence Interval | Fixed Point is stable; Recurrence Interval is periodic |
