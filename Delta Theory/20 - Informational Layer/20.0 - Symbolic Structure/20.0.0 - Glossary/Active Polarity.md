# Active Polarity (P⁺)

> The generative pole in a [[Polarity]] system that drives change, expansion, and difference propagation through dynamic exploration.

## Definition

Active Polarity (P⁺) represents the dynamic, exploratory aspect of a polarity system that initiates change and transformation. It emerges from [[PrimitiveDifference|∆]] through relational embedding and maintains difference's generative nature. Contains P⁻ₙ₊₁ at its core through nested counter-rotation.
