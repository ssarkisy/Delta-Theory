# Interference (dynamic)

> Superposition of signals yields constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relations and resolution.

---

## Definition

- Signal overlap effects
- Phase-dependent outcomes
- Resolution-bounded mixing
- Constructive/destructive patterns

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Signal mix | Wave combine | `Monitor`, `Mix` |
| Phase match | Pattern align | `Check`, `Phase` |
| Resolution | Signal split | `Test`, `Split` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Signal mix | Coming together | "Blends in" |
| Phase match | Working together | "Fits well" |
| Resolution | Telling apart | "Sees clearly" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Wave combine | Coming together | How mixing works |
| Pattern align | Working together | How fit happens |
| Signal split | Telling apart | How clarity forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Wave mix | Energy blend |
| Networks | Signal cross | Message mix |
| Cognition | Pattern blend | Thought mix |
| Systems | State merge | Flow blend |

## Scale Effects

How Interference manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Mix quantum | Wave blend |
| λV | Gate cross | State mix |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase mix | Pattern blend |
| ∇S | Mix clarity | Clear cross |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave mix | Light blend |
| λV | Field cross | Space mix |

Note: At extreme scales, interference faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum superposition at ε, causal mixing at c).

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: mix resolution met
- π: phase relation clear
- ψA: pattern separable
- λV: gates selective

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern mix | Wave clarity |
| Human | λV | Gate cross | Flow control |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase blend | Field mixing |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Over-mix | Pattern blur | Lost clarity |
| Human | Bad cross | Wrong blend | Poor fit |
| Cosmic | Field blur | Structure mix | Lost distinction |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Phase relation clear
- [ ] Resolution sufficient
- [ ] Mix controlled
- [ ] Patterns distinct

Humane tests:
- [ ] Blend natural
- [ ] Parts clear
- [ ] Mix balanced
- [ ] Flow smooth

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical interference nor experiential mixing alone captures its full meaning.
