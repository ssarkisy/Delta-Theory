# Interference (dynamic)

> Superposition of signals yields constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relations and resolution.

---

## Definition

- Overlap of propagations leads to amplification or cancellation; outcome depends on relative phase and ε

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π: phase relation; constructive vs destructive
- ε: ability to resolve overlapping signals

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA sets tolerance for phase mismatch
- λV gating can suppress or pass interfering components
- ∇S partitioning can separate or mix paths

---

## Failure Modes

- Masking of useful signals; false positives/negatives in diagnostics

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Relative phase measured; predicted outcome matches
- [ ] Resolution sufficient to separate components
- [ ] Gate tuning avoids pathological masking

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: wave interference, diffraction
- Chemistry: reaction pathway competition; inhibitor effects
- Biology: cross‑talk between signaling pathways
- Social: overlapping norms/roles causing conflict or synergy
- Politics: message interference; agenda collision
- Networks: signal collision, cross‑traffic interference
- Cognition: competing narratives; attentional masking
