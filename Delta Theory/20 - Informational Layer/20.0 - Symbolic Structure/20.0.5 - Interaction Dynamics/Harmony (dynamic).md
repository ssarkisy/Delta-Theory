# Harmony (dynamic)

> Aggregate coherence across components; aligns without rigidity and adapts under bounded perturbations.

---

## Definition

- Flexible component alignment
- Adaptive coherence pattern
- Balanced variation
- Stable yet adaptable

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Component fit | State align | `Monitor`, `Fit` |
| Adaptation | Change handle | `Check`, `Adapt` |
| Balance | Load share | `Test`, `Share` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Component fit | Working together | "Fits well" |
| Adaptation | Growing change | "Flows with" |
| Balance | Fair share | "Even spread" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| State align | Working together | How parts fit |
| Change handle | Growing change | How flow works |
| Load share | Fair share | How balance forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Oscillator sync | Natural rhythm |
| Networks | Service blend | Living balance |
| Cognition | Pattern fit | Smooth thought |
| Systems | State harmony | Natural flow |

## Scale Effects

How Harmony manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum harmony | Wave blend |
| λV | Gate balance | State fit |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase harmony | Pattern flow |
| ∇S | Balance clarity | Clear fit |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave harmony | Light blend |
| λV | Field balance | Space fit |

Note: At extreme scales, harmony faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum coherence at ε, causal harmony at c).

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: residuals bounded
- π/φ: relations stable
- ψA: coherence flexible
- λV: gates balanced

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern fit | Wave clarity |
| Human | λV | Gate harmony | Flow balance |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase blend | Field binding |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Over-fit | Pattern rigid | Lost freedom |
| Human | Bad blend | Flow break | Poor balance |
| Cosmic | Field clash | Structure jar | Lost harmony |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Components align
- [ ] Change handled
- [ ] Load balanced
- [ ] Flow smooth

Humane tests:
- [ ] Parts work well
- [ ] Growth natural
- [ ] Share fair
- [ ] Feel balanced

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical alignment nor experiential harmony alone captures its full meaning.
