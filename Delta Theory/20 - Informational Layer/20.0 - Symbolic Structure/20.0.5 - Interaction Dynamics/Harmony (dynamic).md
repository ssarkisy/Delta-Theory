# Harmony (dynamic)

> Aggregate coherence across components; aligns without rigidity and adapts under bounded perturbations.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: residuals below tolerance; misfits don’t accumulate
- π/φ: phase/proportion relations support blended coherence

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA binds across recurrence intervals; λV passes informative variation; ∇S balances detail vs whole

---

## Failure Modes

- Overbound (rigidity) or dissonance (persistent conflict)

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Coherence holds under modest context change
- [ ] Variation is informative, not noise
- [ ] No critical bottlenecks

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: coupled oscillators with stable beat frequencies
- Chemistry: stable complexes; cooperative binding
- Biology: homeostasis; coordinated organ rhythms
- Social: complementary roles; cooperative norms
- Politics: coalition stability; policy coherence across ministries
- Networks: stable multi‑service coexistence; QoS honored
- Cognition: integrated self with flexible adaptation
