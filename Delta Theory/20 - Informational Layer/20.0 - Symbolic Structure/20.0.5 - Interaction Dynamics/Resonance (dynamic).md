# Resonance (dynamic)

> Constructive phase alignment; amplification within safe windows set by anchors and SVA.

---

## Definition

- Phase alignment increases amplitude/energy transfer; bounded by capacity and stability

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π: phase geometry alignment
- c: propagation capacity ceiling; avoid overload
- ε: minimal phase resolution for lock

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA: establishes and maintains lock
- λV: gate must admit the reinforcing signals
- ∇S: excessive partitioning can prevent global lock

---

## Failure Modes

- Over‑amplification → saturation/instability; loss of lock under jitter

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Phase error within lock window
- [ ] Amplitude/throughput below c
- [ ] Stable under small perturbations

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: driven oscillator at natural frequency; Q factor
- Chemistry: resonance structures; conjugation stability windows
- Biology: circadian entrainment; neural synchrony (gamma band)
- Social: shared rhythms/rituals producing group cohesion
- Politics: message cadence aligning with public attention cycles
- Networks: protocol heartbeat lock; PLL/consensus lock
- Cognition: flow state; entrained attention
