# Dissonance (glossary)

> Persistent phase conflict/tension; may be informative (edge detection) or destructive (instability).

---

## Definition

- Phase conflict pattern
- Productive or destructive
- Tension dynamics
- Edge detection role
- Represents interaction dynamics diagnostic for identifying persistent phase conflicts that create tension, enabling either productive differentiation through edge detection or destructive instability through unresolved conflict

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → ψA (Phase Coherence) → Phase interaction → Dissonance (persistent phase conflict)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → ψA modulates phase coherence → Phase interactions create conflicts → Persistent phase misalignment generates tension that can enable productive edge detection or create destructive instability

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying persistent phase conflict dynamics where misaligned phase relationships create tension, representing a specific conflict mode of phase interaction that can either enhance differentiation through productive tension or degrade system stability through destructive conflict

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Phase clash | State conflict | `Monitor`, `Clash` |
| Edge detect | Pattern break | `Check`, `Edge` |
| Tension | Load stress | `Test`, `Stress` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase clash | Not fitting | "Doesn't work" |
| Edge detect | Finding limits | "Sees bounds" |
| Tension | Feeling strain | "Under stress" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| State conflict | Not fitting | How clash works |
| Pattern break | Finding limits | How edges form |
| Load stress | Feeling strain | How tension builds |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Mode clash | Energy strain |
| Networks | Service clash | Link stress |
| Cognition | Pattern clash | Thought strain |
| Systems | State clash | Flow stress |

## Scale Effects

How Dissonance manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum clash | Wave break |
| λV | Gate stress | State clash |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase clash | Pattern break |
| ∇S | Edge clarity | Clear bounds |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave clash | Light break |
| λV | Field stress | Space strain |

Note: At extreme scales, dissonance faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, causal tension at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary tension enables structural differentiation and edge detection |
| Void | Void conflict allows productive tension and selective filtering |
| Awareness | Phase conflict enables coherent differentiation and boundary recognition |

Diagnostic for persistent phase conflict dynamics where misaligned phase relationships create tension for productive differentiation or destructive instability.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Dissonance | Resonance | Phase conflict vs phase alignment |
| Dissonance | Harmony | Persistent tension vs flexible coherence |
| Dissonance | Interference | Productive conflict vs pattern mixing |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Persistent phase conflict dynamics creating tension that enables productive differentiation or destructive instability

**Key Tests:**
- **Phase conflict identification:** Verify persistent misalignment between phase relationships
- **Tension assessment:** Check for productive vs destructive tension dynamics
- **Edge detection evaluation:** Measure boundary recognition and differentiation capability
- **Stability impact analysis:** Assess whether conflict enhances or degrades system stability

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify persistent misalignment between phase relationships creating conflict
- [ ] Check for productive vs destructive tension dynamics and outcomes
- [ ] Measure boundary recognition and edge detection capability from conflict
- [ ] Assess whether phase conflict enhances or degrades overall system stability

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Tension feels productive and informative rather than purely destructive
- [ ] Boundaries and limits feel clear and well-defined through conflict
- [ ] Strain feels bearable and manageable within system capacity
- [ ] Growth and differentiation feel possible through productive tension
