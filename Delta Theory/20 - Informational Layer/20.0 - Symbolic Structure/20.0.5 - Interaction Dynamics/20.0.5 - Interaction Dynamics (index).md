# 20.0.5 - Interaction Dynamics (index)

> Observational dynamics at interfaces and within loops; tie to anchors (ε, c, π/φ) and SVA (∇S, λV, ψA).

## Dynamics

| Dynamic | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Resonance (dynamic)]] | Constructive phase alignment; amplification within safe windows |
| [[Interference (dynamic)]] | Constructive/destructive mixing based on phase relations |
| [[Harmony (dynamic)]] | Aggregate coherence across components; aligns without rigidity |
| [[Dissonance (dynamic)]] | Persistent phase conflict/tension; useful or destructive |

Note: Jamming/Saturation is covered under [[Saturated Field (classification)]].
