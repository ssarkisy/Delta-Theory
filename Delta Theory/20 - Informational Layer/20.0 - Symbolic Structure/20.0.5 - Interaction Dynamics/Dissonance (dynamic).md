# Dissonance (dynamic)

> Persistent phase conflict/tension; may be informative (edge detection) or destructive (instability).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: conflict above residual tolerance
- π: phase relations far from alignment; beats/roughness

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S highlights edges (useful dissonance)
- λV can either admit conflict (exploration) or filter it out (stability)
- ψA low/misaligned → instability; tuned → controlled tension

---

## Failure Modes

- Unresolved conflict leads to oscillation or collapse

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Conflict localized and informative vs global and destructive
- [ ] Gate/phase tuning yields desired regime

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: inharmonic coupling; mode competition
- Chemistry: competing bonding patterns; frustrated lattices
- Biology: arrhythmias; maladaptive signaling loops
- Social: norm clashes; culture conflict producing tension
- Politics: polarized agendas; legislative deadlock or productive debate
- Networks: service interference; policy conflicts
- Cognition: cognitive dissonance; creative tension vs paralysis
