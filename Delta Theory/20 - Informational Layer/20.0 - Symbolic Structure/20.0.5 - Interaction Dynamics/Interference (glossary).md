# Interference (glossary)

> Superposition of signals yields constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relations and resolution.

---

## Definition

- Signal overlap effects
- Phase-dependent outcomes
- Resolution-bounded mixing
- Constructive/destructive patterns
- Represents interaction dynamics diagnostic for identifying superposition effects where overlapping signals create constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relationships and resolution boundaries

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Flow (Pattern) → Signal superposition → Interference (pattern mixing)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Flow creates propagation patterns → Signal overlap creates superposition → Phase relationships determine constructive/destructive outcomes based on resolution boundaries

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying pattern mixing dynamics where overlapping signals create superposition effects with constructive or destructive outcomes, representing a specific mode of flow interaction that depends on phase relationships and resolution boundaries for outcome determination

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Signal mix | Wave combine | `Monitor`, `Mix` |
| Phase match | Pattern align | `Check`, `Phase` |
| Resolution | Signal split | `Test`, `Split` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Signal mix | Coming together | "Blends in" |
| Phase match | Working together | "Fits well" |
| Resolution | Telling apart | "Sees clearly" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Wave combine | Coming together | How mixing works |
| Pattern align | Working together | How fit happens |
| Signal split | Telling apart | How clarity forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Wave mix | Energy blend |
| Networks | Signal cross | Message mix |
| Cognition | Pattern blend | Thought mix |
| Systems | State merge | Flow blend |

## Scale Effects

How Interference manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Mix quantum | Wave blend |
| λV | Gate cross | State mix |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase mix | Pattern blend |
| ∇S | Mix clarity | Clear cross |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave mix | Light blend |
| λV | Field cross | Space mix |

Note: At extreme scales, interference faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum superposition at ε, causal mixing at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary resolution determines constructive/destructive pattern mixing outcomes |
| Void | Void filtering enables selective superposition and controlled interference effects |
| Awareness | Phase discrimination allows coherent pattern separation and interference detection |

Diagnostic for pattern mixing dynamics where overlapping signals create superposition effects with constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relationships.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Interference | Resonance | Pattern mixing vs phase amplification |
| Interference | Harmony | Superposition effects vs flexible coherence |
| Interference | Dissonance | Phase-dependent outcomes vs persistent conflict |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Pattern mixing dynamics creating superposition effects where overlapping signals produce constructive or destructive outcomes based on phase relationships and resolution boundaries

**Key Tests:**
- **Phase relationship assessment:** Determine constructive vs destructive interference patterns
- **Resolution boundary verification:** Confirm adequate signal separation and mixing control
- **Superposition outcome evaluation:** Measure constructive/destructive pattern effects
- **Signal overlap analysis:** Assess overlap effects and pattern mixing dynamics

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Determine constructive vs destructive interference patterns in phase relationships
- [ ] Confirm adequate signal separation and mixing control at resolution boundaries
- [ ] Measure constructive/destructive pattern effects in superposition outcomes
- [ ] Assess overlap effects and pattern mixing dynamics in signal interactions

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Patterns blend naturally with clear constructive or destructive outcomes
- [ ] Signal parts remain distinguishable while creating meaningful mixing effects
- [ ] Mixing feels balanced and controlled rather than chaotic or overwhelming
- [ ] Flow interactions create coherent superposition rather than confusion
