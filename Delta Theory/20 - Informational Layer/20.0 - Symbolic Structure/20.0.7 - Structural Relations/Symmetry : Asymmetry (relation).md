# Symmetry / Asymmetry (relation)

> Invariance vs directed bias across interactions; relates to φ and closure geometry.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π: symmetry/phase relations; invariant operations
- φ: asymmetric stabilization bias (propagation vs absorption)

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S breaks or preserves symmetry; λV may impose directional bias; ψA binds symmetric patterns

---

## Failure Modes

- Unintended asymmetry → drift; excessive symmetry → stagnation

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Desired symmetries preserved; biases intentional
- [ ] Effects under transformation tested (renaming, reordering)

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: conservation laws; parity breaking
- Chemistry: chiral effects; directional catalysis
- Biology: bilateral symmetry; left‑right asymmetry
- Social/Politics: equal rules vs power asymmetries
- Economy: symmetric vs asymmetric information
- Networks: symmetric vs asymmetric protocols
- Cognition: balanced vs biased reasoning patterns
