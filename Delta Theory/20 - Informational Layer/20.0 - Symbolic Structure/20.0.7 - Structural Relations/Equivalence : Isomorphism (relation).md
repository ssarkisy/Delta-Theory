# Equivalence / Isomorphism (relation)

> Same structure under relabeling; functionally interchangeable within a context.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π/φ: invariants preserved under mapping
- ε: differences below resolution treated as equivalent

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S may reveal distinctions breaking equivalence; ψA may bind variants

---

## Failure Modes

- False equivalence hides critical differences; brittle substitution

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Mapping preserves required invariants
- [ ] Substitution test passes under load

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: symmetry/isomorphism classes
- Chemistry: functional group equivalence
- Biology: homologous structures
- Social/Politics: equivalent roles; interchangeable procedures
- Economy: fungibility; instrument equivalence
- Networks: isomorphic topologies; API compatibility
- Cognition: synonymy; schema isomorphism
