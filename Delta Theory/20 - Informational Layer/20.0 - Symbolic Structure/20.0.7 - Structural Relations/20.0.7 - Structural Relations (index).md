# 20.0.7 - Structural Relations (index)

> Observational graph relations over Forms/Fields. Tie to anchors (ε, π/φ) and SVA (∇S, λV, ψA).

## Relations Framework

| Relation | Description | Key Test |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| [[Adjacency : Incidence (relation)]] | Interface touch | Contact check |
| [[Containment : Embedding (relation)]] | Scope nesting | Part-of test |
| [[Equivalence : Isomorphism (relation)]] | Structure same | Map check |
| [[Dependency : Constraint (relation)]] | Need/provide | Gate test |
| [[Compatibility : Conflict (relation)]] | Co-bind check | Tension test |
| [[Symmetry : Asymmetry (relation)]] | Balance/bias | Direction test |
| [[Bridge : Articulation (relation)]] | Critical link | Connect test |
| [[Ribbed Relational Embedding (property)]] | Layered nest | Level test |

Each relation provides:
- Technical and humane test criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Relation behavior patterns
- Stability conditions
