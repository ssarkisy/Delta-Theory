# 20.0.7 - Structural Relations (index)

> Observational graph relations over Forms/Fields. Tie to anchors (ε, π/φ) and SVA (∇S, λV, ψA).

## Relations

| Relation | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Adjacency / Incidence (relation)]] | Which interfaces touch; direct interaction possible |
| [[Containment / Embedding (relation)]] | Part‑of / scope nesting; R(·) depth/context |
| [[Equivalence / Isomorphism (relation)]] | Same structure under relabeling; functional sameness |
| [[Dependency / Constraint (relation)]] | Requires/provides; gating and ordering |
| [[Compatibility / Conflict (relation)]] | Can co‑bind without interference vs tension |
| [[Symmetry / Asymmetry (relation)]] | Invariance vs directed bias across interactions |
| [[Bridge / Articulation (relation)]] | Critical connector between regions |
