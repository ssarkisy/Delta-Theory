# Containment / Embedding (relation)

> Part‑of / scope nesting; expresses R(·) depth and context.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: boundary clarity to distinguish scopes
- π/φ: geometry/asymmetry of nesting

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S defines strata; λV exposes/hides nested layers; ψA maintains coherence across nested loops

---

## Failure Modes

- Leaky containment; scope confusion; hidden collapse layers

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Boundaries explicit and enforced
- [ ] Nested closures stable across k

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: hierarchical domains; boundary layers
- Chemistry: micelles; encapsulation; solvation shells
- Biology: organelles; tissues within organs
- Social/Politics: departments within ministries; subcommittees
- Economy: subsidiaries within holding structures
- Networks: overlay/underlay; namespaces; subnets
- Cognition: schema within schema; hierarchical concepts
