# Compatibility / Conflict (relation)

> Can components co‑bind without interference vs exhibit persistent tension.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- π/φ: phase/proportion relations enabling harmony vs dissonance
- ε: minimal discrepancy tolerance

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA binds compatible parts; ∇S reveals conflicts; λV can filter or admit tension intentionally

---

## Failure Modes

- Hidden conflicts cause collapse under load; false compatibility masks risk

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Compatibility tests under realistic load/jitter
- [ ] Intentional conflict bounded and useful (edge detection)

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: impedance matching vs mismatch
- Chemistry: miscibility; reactive incompatibilities
- Biology: immune compatibility; symbiosis vs antagonism
- Social/Politics: coalition compatibility; factional conflict
- Economy: product/market fit; competing incentives
- Networks: API/protocol compatibility; policy conflicts
- Cognition: belief coherence vs cognitive dissonance
