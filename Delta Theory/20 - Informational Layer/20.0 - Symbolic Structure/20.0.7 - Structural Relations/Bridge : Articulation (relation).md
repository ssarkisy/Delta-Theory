# Bridge / Articulation (relation)

> Critical connector whose failure isolates regions (structural relation view).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: minimal signal to traverse
- c: capacity limit determines bottleneck behavior

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: defines partition boundaries the bridge spans
- λV: gate can act as circuit breaker
- ψA: synchronization across the bridge for stable interaction

---

## Failure Modes

- Partitioned network; bottleneck amplification; hotspot collapse

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Identify single points; add redundancy
- [ ] Gate tuning (λV) for safe operation
- [ ] Monitor load vs c and phase alignment
