# Bridge : Articulation (relation)

> Critical connector whose failure isolates regions (structural relation view).

---

## Definition

- Key link pattern
- Critical connect
- Join point role
- Bridge function

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Key link | Must path | `Monitor`, `Link` |
| Join point | Cross gate | `Check`, `Join` |
| Bridge role | Connect need | `Test`, `Bridge` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Key link | Only way | "Must cross" |
| Join point | Meeting place | "Comes together" |
| Bridge role | Connects sides | "Links parts" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Must path | Only way | How critical works |
| Cross gate | Meeting place | How join flows |
| Connect need | Connects sides | How bridge forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Force bridge | Energy link |
| Networks | Node join | Link bridge |
| Cognition | Mind bridge | Think link |
| Systems | Flow join | Move bridge |

## Scale Effects

How Bridge manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum link | Wave join |
| λV | Gate bridge | State link |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase join | Pattern link |
| ∇S | Structure bridge | Clear join |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave link | Light join |
| λV | Field bridge | Space link |

Note: At extreme scales, bridges face fundamental limits (e.g., quantum joining at ε, causal linking at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: link clarity
- c: join speed
- ψA: phase bridge
- λV: gate link

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern link | Wave join |
| Human | λV | Gate bridge | Flow link |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase join | Field bridge |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Link break | Pattern split | Can't cross |
| Human | Join fail | Flow cut | No way through |
| Cosmic | Bridge loss | Field split | Parts cut |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Link works
- [ ] Join holds
- [ ] Bridge stable
- [ ] Connect flows

Humane tests:
- [ ] Way clear
- [ ] Parts meet
- [ ] Sides join
- [ ] Flow moves

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical bridging nor experiential connecting alone captures its full meaning.
