# Adjacency / Incidence (relation)

> Which interfaces touch; direct interaction is possible.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: interface resolution sufficient to detect adjacency
- λV: gates allow contact; otherwise “adjacent” but inactive

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S defines distinct boundaries; λV controls contact; ψA governs sustained interaction

---

## Failure Modes

- False adjacency due to masking; missed adjacency due to under‑resolution

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Interfaces present and open (λV)
- [ ] Resolution adequate (ε)

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: contacting surfaces; coupling interfaces
- Chemistry: reactive adjacency; docking sites
- Biology: cell‑cell junctions; synaptic contacts
- Social/Politics: shared committees; joint sessions
- Economy: connected markets; counterparty links
- Networks: L2 adjacency; BGP peering
- Cognition: association links
