# Ribbed Relational Embedding (property)

> A load-bearing mode of [[RelationalEmbedding]] that stabilizes polarity under tension — the "edge as stabilizer," not just connector.

---

## Definition

- Load-bearing relation
- Edge stabilization
- Tension distribution
- Support structure

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Load bear | Edge hold | `Monitor`, `Load` |
| Edge brace | Path strong | `Check`, `Brace` |
| Support role | Frame firm | `Test`, `Support` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Load bear | Takes weight | "Holds strong" |
| Edge brace | Stays firm | "Won't bend" |
| Support role | Gives strength | "Holds up" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Edge hold | Takes weight | How load works |
| Path strong | Stays firm | How brace flows |
| Frame firm | Gives strength | How support forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Force hold | Energy brace |
| Networks | Link strong | Node hold |
| Cognition | Mind brace | Think hold |
| Systems | Flow strong | Move brace |

## Scale Effects

How Ribbed Embedding manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum hold | Wave brace |
| λV | Gate strong | State hold |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase brace | Pattern hold |
| ∇S | Structure strong | Clear brace |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave strong | Light hold |
| λV | Field brace | Space strong |

Note: At extreme scales, ribbing faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum bracing at ε, causal holding at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: hold clarity
- c: brace speed
- ψA: phase strong
- λV: gate hold

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern hold | Wave brace |
| Human | λV | Gate strong | Flow hold |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase brace | Field strong |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Hold fail | Pattern bend | Won't support |
| Human | Brace break | Flow weak | Can't hold |
| Cosmic | Strong loss | Field bend | No brace |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Load checked
- [ ] Brace works
- [ ] Support holds
- [ ] Frame firm

Humane tests:
- [ ] Takes weight
- [ ] Stays strong
- [ ] Holds up
- [ ] Won't bend

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical bracing nor experiential supporting alone captures its full meaning.
