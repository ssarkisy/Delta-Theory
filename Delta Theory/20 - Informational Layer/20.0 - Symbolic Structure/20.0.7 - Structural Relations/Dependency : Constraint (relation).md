# Dependency / Constraint (relation)

> Requires/provides relations; gating and ordering constraints at interfaces.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- λV: preconditions; thresholds for progression
- ε: minimal evidence to satisfy dependency

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S adds prerequisite layers; ψA sequences retention/ordering

---

## Failure Modes

- Deadlocks; starvation; invalid states when constraints are bypassed

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Dependencies enumerated and checkable
- [ ] Ordering enforced; rollback paths present

---

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: boundary conditions; conservation constraints
- Chemistry: reaction prerequisites; catalytic requirements
- Biology: pathway dependencies; developmental sequences
- Social/Politics: procedural rules; quorum & committee chains
- Economy: regulatory/compliance preconditions
- Networks: service dependencies; startup ordering
- Cognition: prerequisite knowledge; task sequencing
