# Collapsed Form (classification)

> Fails stabilization; differences dissipate or implode rather than forming persistent structure.

---

## Definition

- Closure fails at or before some $k \le n$: $⊚(R^k(∆_0))$ not satisfied
- No durable identity; interactions do not self‑reinforce

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: signals under resolution; cannot clear gates
- λV/c: overload or starvation at interfaces; propagation breaks
- ψA: cannot maintain phase across recurrence intervals

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S too high → fragmentation; too low → blur; neither permits closure
- λV mis‑tuned → noise floods or starvation
- ψA too weak → desynchronization

---

## Failure Modes

- Noise floor dominance; runaway amplification then crash; dead loops

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Gate: admissible signals present (|∆| ≥ ε)?
- [ ] Capacity: within c and resource limits?
- [ ] Phase: coherence window satisfied?

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: damping to zero; failed nucleation
- Networks/Control: congestion collapse; persistent timeouts
- Cognition: fleeting impressions; no memory consolidation
