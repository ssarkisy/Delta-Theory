# Stable Form (classification)

> A Form whose recursive embeddings satisfy closure across layers; persists under bounded perturbations.

---

## Definition

- For $F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0))$, stability holds if for all $k \le n$: coherence thresholds are met and no collapse gaps exist
- Practical: “within ε” tolerance; retains identity across recurrence intervals

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: sub‑ε fluctuations do not perturb closure; |∆| ≥ ε at active interfaces
- π: closure geometry coherent across layers (no misfold discontinuities)
- e: growth/decay in bounds that preserve feedback viability
- φ: asymmetry bias supports propagation without runaway or sink
- c: interactions remain below propagation ceilings

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: enough differentiation to delineate boundaries without fragmentation
- λV: gate windows tuned to pass signal and reject noise
- ψA: phase/memory sufficient to bind cycles across layers

---

## Failure Modes

- Hidden collapse at intermediate k (apparent stability only)
- Over‑differentiation (fragmentation), starvation (over‑gating), desynchronization

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] All active layers meet closure predicates
- [ ] Phase/coherence window satisfied (recurrence interval)
- [ ] Noise < ε; no overspeed vs c

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: phase‑locked oscillations; conserved quantities stable
- Networks/Control: steady throughput; bounded latency/jitter
- Cognition: memory/identity continuity across contexts
