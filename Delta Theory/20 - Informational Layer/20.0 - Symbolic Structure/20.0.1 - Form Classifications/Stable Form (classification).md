# Stable Form (classification)

> A Form whose recursive embeddings satisfy closure across layers; persists under bounded perturbations.

---

## Definition

- For $F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0))$, stability holds if for all $k \le n$: coherence thresholds are met and no collapse gaps exist
- Practical: "within ε" tolerance; retains identity across recurrence intervals

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Stability | State persistence | `StateCheck`, `Monitor` |
| Coherence | Layer binding | `LayerSync`, `Validate` |
| Resilience | Perturbation bounds | `ErrorMargin`, `Limits` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Stability | Natural balance | "Holds its shape" |
| Coherence | Clear pattern | "Makes sense together" |
| Resilience | Adaptability | "Stays true through change" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Persistence | Balance | How form maintains itself |
| Layer binding | Pattern clarity | How parts cohere |
| Error margin | Flexibility | How much change it handles |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Phase stability | Natural rhythm |
| Networks | State persistence | Living connection |
| Cognition | Memory coherence | Clear presence |
| Systems | Bounded variation | Organic stability |

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Threshold | Test |
|----------|-----------|------|
| ε | |∆| ≥ ε at interfaces | Quantum measurement |
| λV | Discrete state gaps | Energy level check |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Threshold | Test |
|----------|-----------|------|
| ψA | Phase coherence window | Pattern recognition |
| ∇S | Structure differentiation | Boundary clarity |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Threshold | Test |
|----------|-----------|------|
| c | Propagation speed limit | Causal connection |
| λV | Interface horizon | Field stability |

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Quantum structure | Wave-particle stability |
| Human | λV | Interface gating | Clear boundaries |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase binding | Coherent field |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Collapse | Decoherence | Pattern loss |
| Human | Fragment | Over-differentiation | Boundary break |
| Cosmic | Desync | Phase drift | Connection loss |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] All active layers meet closure predicates
- [ ] Phase/coherence window satisfied
- [ ] Noise < ε; no overspeed vs c
- [ ] Layer binding validated

Humane tests:
- [ ] Pattern feels clear and stable
- [ ] Natural rhythm maintained
- [ ] Adapts to changes smoothly
- [ ] Parts work together naturally

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical stability metrics nor experiential balance alone captures its full meaning.
