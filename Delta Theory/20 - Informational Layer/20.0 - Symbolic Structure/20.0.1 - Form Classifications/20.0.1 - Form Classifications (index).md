# 20.0.1 - Form Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes over `Form` based on operational invariants and thresholds. Observational schema; not kernel.

## Classes

| Class | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Stable Form (classification)]] | Fully stabilized across embedding layers; persists under perturbation |
| [[Apparent Form (classification)]] | Looks coherent locally but hides internal collapse/fragmentation |
| [[Collapsed Form (classification)]] | Fails stabilization; differences dissipate or implode |
| [[Pseudo Form (classification)]] | Performative/illusory coherence; no closure support across layers |
