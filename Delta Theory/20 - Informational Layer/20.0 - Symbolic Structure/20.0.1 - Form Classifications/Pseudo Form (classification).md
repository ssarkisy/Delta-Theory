# Pseudo Form (classification)

> Performative/illusory coherence: appears structured by convention or presentation, but lacks closure support across layers.

---

## Definition

- Local cues or metadata suggest a Form, but critical closure predicates are missing
- Often relies on external scaffolding or agreement rather than internal stabilization

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: below‑resolution “signals” painted as structure
- φ: asymmetry exploited to mimic balance; collapses under probe

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: over‑classification creates the illusion of boundaries
- λV: gates drop contradictory signals; curated input stream
- ψA: superficial synchronization without long‑term retention

---

## Failure Modes

- Falls apart under uncurated inputs; cannot survive context change

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Closure evidence at multiple k (not just surface)?
- [ ] Behavior persists when λV is relaxed/tightened?
- [ ] Phase holds after delays/jitter?

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: apparent resonances from instrument artifacts
- Networks/Control: vanity dashboards; metrics without causality
- Cognition: confabulated narratives; suggestibility effects
