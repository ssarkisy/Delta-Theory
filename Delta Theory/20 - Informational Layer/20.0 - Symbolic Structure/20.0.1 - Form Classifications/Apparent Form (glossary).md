# Apparent Form (classification)

> Looks coherent locally, but hides instability at one or more embedding layers.

---

## Definition

- For some $k < n$, $⊚(R^k(∆_0))$ fails or is marginal; local views appear stable
- Surface stability masks deeper instability
- Represents partial closure failure in the recursive embedding sequence where outer layers achieve stability while inner layers remain unstable

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** A1 (Irreducibility) → T2 (Recursivity) → ⊚ (Stabilization) → Form → Apparent Form (partial closure failure)

**Flow:** ∆ generates difference → R(·) creates recursive embeddings → ⊚ attempts closure at multiple layers → partial failure creates apparent stability masking deeper instability

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying incomplete recursive closure where Form pattern emergence is compromised by hidden layer failures

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Hidden failure | Layer check | `DeepProbe`, `Audit` |
| Masked instability | State verify | `CrossCheck`, `Stress` |
| Surface stability | Interface test | `Boundary`, `Mock` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Hidden failure | Deep weakness | "Seems fine but..." |
| Masked instability | Covered problem | "Paper over cracks" |
| Surface stability | Looks good | "Fine on surface" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Layer check | Deep look | How we find hidden issues |
| State verify | True test | How we reveal masks |
| Interface test | Surface check | How we spot facades |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Metastable check | Hidden stress |
| Networks | Deep probe | Masked break |
| Cognition | Context switch | Brittle pattern |
| Systems | Layer audit | Hidden weakness |

## Scale Effects

How Apparent Form manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution masking:** Sub-ε instabilities remain undetectable
- **Example:** Quantum metastable states with hidden decay channels

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence masking:** Phase coherence conceals temporal instabilities
- **Example:** Social institutions with hidden structural contradictions

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Horizon masking:** Causal limits conceal distant instabilities
- **Example:** Local cosmic structures within larger unstable dynamics

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Incomplete boundary formation with hidden gaps |
| Void | Masked discontinuities compromising integrity |
| Awareness | False coherence masking deeper incoherence |

Diagnostic for partial SVA triad failures where surface stability masks underlying compromise.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Apparent Form | Stable Form | Hidden instabilities vs complete closure |
| Apparent Form | Collapsed Form | Surface coherence vs obvious failure |
| Apparent Form | Pseudo Form | Incomplete closure vs no genuine closure |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Surface stability masking deeper instability across all scales

**Key Tests:**
- **Layer audit:** Check intermediate closure at each recursive level k
- **Stress testing:** Apply perturbations to reveal hidden weaknesses
- **Deep probing:** Examine sub-surface structural integrity
- **Context switching:** Test stability under varying conditions

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Layer audit at each recursive level k < n
- [ ] Stress test under perturbation to reveal instabilities
- [ ] Deep probe beyond surface interfaces
- [ ] Verify closure completeness across embedding layers

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Look beneath surface appearances
- [ ] Test under real-world stress conditions
- [ ] Verify authentic vs performative stability
- [ ] Challenge initial stability assumptions
