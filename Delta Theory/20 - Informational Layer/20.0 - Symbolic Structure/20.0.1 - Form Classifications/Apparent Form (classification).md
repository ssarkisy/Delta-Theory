# Apparent Form (classification)

> Looks coherent locally, but hides instability at one or more embedding layers.

---

## Definition

- For some $k < n$, $⊚(R^k(∆_0))$ fails or is marginal; local views appear stable

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: stability window too tight at hidden layers; sub‑ε drift accumulates
- π: misfolded geometry causing latent discontinuities
- e/φ: runaway feedback or bias trapping at specific layers

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: over‑differentiation creates brittle sub‑forms
- λV: gates tuned to mask instability (drops useful signals)
- ψA: insufficient phase to bind across problematic layers

---

## Failure Modes

- Sudden collapse when perturbed; oscillation between quasi‑stable states

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Intermediate layer audit: explicit checks at each k
- [ ] Reveal masked Voids: lower/raise λV and observe response
- [ ] Phase stress test: jitter/timeout variation

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: metastable phases; delayed failure under load
- Networks/Control: flapping routes; intermittent consensus
- Cognition: brittle habits; breaks under context switch
