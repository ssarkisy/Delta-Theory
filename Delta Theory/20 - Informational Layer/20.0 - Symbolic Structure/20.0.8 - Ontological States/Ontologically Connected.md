# Ontologically Connected

> Interfaces are open and paths exist; the exterior is observable as a Field.

---

## Definition

- Open interface state
- Path exists check
- Field observable
- Connect pattern

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Open check | Port ready | `Monitor`, `Open` |
| Path test | Link works | `Check`, `Path` |
| Field view | Space seen | `Test`, `Field` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Open check | Way clear | "Can reach" |
| Path test | Can move | "Path there" |
| Field view | Space felt | "See field" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Port ready | Way clear | How open works |
| Link works | Can move | How path flows |
| Space seen | Space felt | How field forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Force path | Energy field |
| Networks | Link open | Node path |
| Cognition | Mind field | Think path |
| Systems | Flow open | Move field |

## Scale Effects

How Connection manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum path | Wave open |
| λV | Gate field | State path |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase open | Pattern path |
| ∇S | Structure field | Clear open |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Wave path | Light open |
| λV | Field open | Space path |

Note: At extreme scales, connection faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum openness at ε, causal paths at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: open clarity
- c: path speed
- ψA: phase field
- λV: gate open

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Pattern open | Wave path |
| Human | λV | Gate field | Flow open |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase path | Field open |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Open fail | Pattern block | No way |
| Human | Path lost | Flow cut | Can't move |
| Cosmic | Field gone | Space block | No field |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Open checked
- [ ] Path works
- [ ] Field seen
- [ ] Connect flows

Humane tests:
- [ ] Way clear
- [ ] Can move
- [ ] Space felt
- [ ] Flow works

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical connection nor experiential openness alone captures its full meaning.
