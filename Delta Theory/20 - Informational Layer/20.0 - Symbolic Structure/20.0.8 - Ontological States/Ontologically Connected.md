- Not a kernel element; a summary label for interface/graph conditions

---

## Pointers

- Interfaces: [[Field]] vs [[Void]]
- Relations: [[Adjacency / Incidence (relation)]] · [[Bridge / Articulation (relation)]]
- Patterns: [[Path (chain) (pattern)]] · [[Multi‑path (redundant) (pattern)]]
- Diagnostics: [[Transparent Field (classification)]]
