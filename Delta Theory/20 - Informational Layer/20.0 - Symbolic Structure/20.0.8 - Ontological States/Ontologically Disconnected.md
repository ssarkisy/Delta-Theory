# Ontologically Disconnected

> Interfaces are closed or absent; no paths exist; the exterior is perceived as Void.

---

## Clarification

- Not a kernel element; a summary label for interface/graph conditions

---

## Pointers

- Interfaces: [[Void]] vs [[Field]]
- Relations: lack of [[Adjacency / Incidence (relation)]]; broken [[Bridge / Articulation (relation)]]
- Patterns: absence of viable [[Path (chain) (pattern)]]/[[Multi‑path (redundant) (pattern)]]
- Diagnostics: [[Masked Field (classification)]] · [[Saturated Field (classification)]] · [[Sparse Field (classification)]]
