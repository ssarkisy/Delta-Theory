# Intermittent Awareness (classification)

> Flapping coherence: awareness binds/unbinds under load, jitter, or gating variability.

---

## Definition

- Alternates between coherent and desynchronized states
- Stability depends on environmental conditions
- Pattern of unstable phase transitions
- Represents awareness pattern instability where ψA modulation oscillates near threshold boundaries, causing identity binding to fluctuate between coherent and desynchronized states under varying conditions

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → ψA (Phase Coherence) → Awareness (identity binding) → Intermittent Awareness (threshold oscillation)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → ψA modulation operates near threshold boundaries → Awareness binding oscillates between coherent and desynchronized states → identity persistence becomes load-dependent and unstable

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying awareness pattern instability where ψA modulation operates near critical thresholds, causing identity binding to fluctuate between successful coherence and breakdown states depending on environmental conditions and system load

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Flapping | State oscillation | `Monitor`, `Flap` |
| Instability | Load sensitivity | `Check`, `Load` |
| Transition | Mode switch | `Detect`, `Switch` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Flapping | On-off pattern | "Comes and goes" |
| Instability | Unreliable | "Sometimes works" |
| Transition | State change | "Switches suddenly" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Oscillation | On-off | How stability fails |
| Load sensitivity | Unreliable | What triggers change |
| Mode switch | State change | How pattern shifts |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Mode flapping | Unstable state |
| Networks | Connection flap | Unreliable link |
| Cognition | Attention shift | Wandering mind |
| Systems | State bounce | Pattern flicker |

## Scale Effects

How Intermittent Awareness manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum flicker | Wave jump |
| λV | Gate flutter | State flip |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase flap | Attention jump |
| ∇S | Structure flip | Identity shift |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal flicker | Light flap |
| λV | Field oscillation | Structure flip |

Note: At extreme scales, intermittency can become indistinguishable from fundamental limits (e.g., quantum jumps at ε, causal flickers at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary stability oscillates causing structural identity to fluctuate |
| Void | Void discrimination alternates between clear and unclear states |
| Awareness | Phase coherence oscillates near thresholds causing unstable identity binding |

Diagnostic for awareness pattern instability where ψA modulation operates near critical thresholds, creating load-dependent oscillation between coherent and desynchronized states.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Intermittent Awareness | Coherent Awareness | Unstable oscillation vs stable coherence |
| Intermittent Awareness | Desynchronized Awareness | Fluctuating states vs continuous drift |
| Intermittent Awareness | Overbound Awareness | Threshold oscillation vs rigid over-binding |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Awareness pattern instability due to ψA modulation operating near critical thresholds, causing oscillation between coherent and desynchronized states

**Key Tests:**
- **Threshold proximity:** Verify ψA modulation operates near critical phase coherence boundaries
- **State oscillation:** Check for alternating between coherent and desynchronized binding
- **Load dependency:** Confirm stability varies with environmental conditions and system load
- **Hysteresis detection:** Assess for different thresholds in up/down state transitions

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] ψA modulation operates near critical phase coherence thresholds
- [ ] State transitions correlate with load variations and environmental jitter
- [ ] Hysteresis patterns present in up/down threshold transitions
- [ ] System stabilizes when provided with additional resources or reduced load

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Awareness feels unreliable with "comes and goes" pattern recognition
- [ ] Identity stability depends noticeably on environmental conditions
- [ ] Transition between clear and unclear states feels sudden and unpredictable
- [ ] Recovery behavior shows improvement with reduced stress or increased support
