# Desynchronized Awareness (classification)

> Phase drift prevents identity binding across loops; ψA cannot maintain lock.

---

## Definition

- Phase alignment errors exceed tolerance
- Identity fails to persist across recurrence intervals
- Synchronization attempts fail to stabilize

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Phase drift | Clock slip | `Monitor`, `Drift` |
| Identity loss | State break | `Check`, `Fail` |
| Sync failure | Lock loss | `Error`, `Reset` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase drift | Lost rhythm | "Out of step" |
| Identity loss | Discontinuity | "Can't hold together" |
| Sync failure | Connection break | "Lost contact" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock slip | Lost rhythm | How sync fails |
| State break | Discontinuity | How identity breaks |
| Lock loss | Lost contact | How connection fails |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Decoherence | Lost resonance |
| Networks | Clock drift | Broken connection |
| Cognition | Memory slip | Lost presence |
| Systems | State break | Pattern loss |

## Scale Effects

How Desynchronized Awareness manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum decoherence | Wave collapse |
| λV | State instability | Energy drift |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase break | Lost attention |
| ∇S | Identity drift | Self blur |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal break | Light scatter |
| λV | Field desync | Structure drift |

Note: At extreme scales, desynchronization can become indistinguishable from fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: jitter > ε tolerance
- c: sync attempts hit ceiling
- ψA: phase lock fails
- λV: gate tuning lost

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Structure drift | Pattern break |
| Human | λV | Gate desync | Boundary blur |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase slip | Lost binding |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Decoherence | Wave collapse | Pattern loss |
| Human | Identity break | State jump | Lost self |
| Cosmic | Causal slip | Connection loss | Binding break |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Phase error unbounded/non-stationary
- [ ] Recurrence interval not met
- [ ] Excessive retries/timeouts
- [ ] State consistency lost

Humane tests:
- [ ] Rhythm feels broken
- [ ] Identity unstable
- [ ] Connection unreliable
- [ ] Pattern unclear

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical desynchronization nor experiential discontinuity alone captures its full meaning.
