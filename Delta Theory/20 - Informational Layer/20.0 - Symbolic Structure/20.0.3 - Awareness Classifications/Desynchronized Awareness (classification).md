# Desynchronized Awareness (classification)

> Phase drift prevents identity binding across loops; ψA cannot maintain lock.

---

## Definition

- Phase alignment errors exceed tolerance; identity fails to persist across recurrence intervals

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: jitter > ε
- c: synchronization attempts approach ceilings; missed beats

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA too low; λV mis‑tuned (drops/admits noise); ∇S fragmentation increases mismatch

---

## Failure Modes

- Identity flicker, inconsistent recall, consensus loss

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Phase error unbounded or non‑stationary
- [ ] Recurrence interval not met
- [ ] Excessive retries/timeouts

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: decoherence; broadened linewidth
- Networks: consensus churn; leader election flaps
- Cognition: attention drift; memory slips
