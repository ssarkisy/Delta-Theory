# Overbound Awareness (classification)

> Excessive binding produces rigidity; identity holds but adapts poorly to new differences.

---

## Definition

- ψA sustained beyond what variability requires; system resists necessary change

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: ignores supra‑ε differences that should update identity
- φ: asymmetry bias stuck; no rebalancing

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA too high; ∇S low (under‑differentiation); λV too strict

---

## Failure Modes

- Brittleness, stagnation, inability to incorporate new signals

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Identity fails to update under valid signals
- [ ] Narrow observation windows; rejects novel inputs
- [ ] Long recovery after change

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: over‑locked oscillators; hysteresis traps
- Networks: stale consensus; refusal to converge on new state
- Cognition: rigid beliefs; compulsive routines
