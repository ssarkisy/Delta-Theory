# Intermittent Awareness (classification)

> Flapping coherence: awareness binds/unbinds under load, jitter, or gating variability.

---

## Definition

- Alternates between coherent and desynchronized states depending on conditions

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: phase error near threshold; small perturbations flip state
- c: capacity margin tight; overload causes drops

---

## SVA Coupling

- λV oscillates; ψA marginal; ∇S changes shift identity boundaries

---

## Failure Modes

- Unreliable memory/identity; inconsistent system behavior

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] State transitions correlate with load/jitter/gating changes
- [ ] Hysteresis identifiable in on/off thresholds
- [ ] Stabilizes when capacity/resolution improved

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: mode‑locking intermittency
- Networks: intermittent consensus; periodic splits/merges
- Cognition: on‑off attention; state‑dependent performance
