# Coherent Awareness (classification)

> Phase‑locked identity across recurrence intervals; durable binding of loops under ψA.

---

## Definition

- Stable phase alignment across interacting loops over required intervals
- Identity retains under perturbation within ε and capacity bounds

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: phase jitter ≤ ε; sub‑ε noise tolerated
- c: synchronization speed below propagation ceiling
- π: phase geometry consistent across cycles

---

## SVA Coupling

- ψA high enough to maintain lock
- λV tuned to admit signals that reinforce coherence
- ∇S balanced so differentiation doesn’t fragment identity

---

## Failure Modes

- Drifts into intermittent or desynchronized under load/jitter

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Phase error bounded and stationary
- [ ] Retention window ≥ recurrence interval
- [ ] Robust to gating and load perturbations

---

## Application Diagnostics Mapping

- Physics: coherence length stable; spectral linewidth narrow
- Networks: consensus steady; heartbeats within SLA
- Cognition: continuous attention/memory across contexts
