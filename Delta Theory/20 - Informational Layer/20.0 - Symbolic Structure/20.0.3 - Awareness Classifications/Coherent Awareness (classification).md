# Coherent Awareness (classification)

> Phase‑locked identity across recurrence intervals; durable binding of loops under ψA.

---

## Definition

- Stable phase alignment across interacting loops over required intervals
- Identity retains under perturbation within ε and capacity bounds
- Maintains coherence through bounded environmental changes

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Phase lock | Clock sync | `Monitor`, `Sync` |
| Identity | State retention | `Cache`, `Memory` |
| Stability | Error bound | `Margin`, `Limit` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase lock | Natural rhythm | "Stays in step" |
| Identity | Self continuity | "Remains itself" |
| Stability | Balance | "Holds steady" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock sync | Rhythm | How cycles align |
| State retention | Continuity | How identity holds |
| Error bound | Balance | How stability works |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Phase stability | Natural resonance |
| Networks | Clock sync | Living connection |
| Cognition | Memory coherence | Clear presence |
| Systems | State stability | Natural flow |

## Scale Effects

How Coherent Awareness manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum coherence | Wave function |
| λV | State stability | Energy level |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase binding | Clear attention |
| ∇S | Identity clarity | Stable self |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal coherence | Light cone |
| λV | Field binding | Cosmic structure |

Note: At extreme scales, coherence faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum decoherence at ε, causal disconnection at c) that affect how stability can be maintained.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: phase jitter ≤ ε; sub-ε noise tolerated
- c: synchronization speed below ceiling
- π: phase geometry consistent
- ψA: binding window sufficient

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Quantum stability | Wave coherence |
| Human | λV | Gate tuning | Clear boundary |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase lock | Stable binding |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Decoherence | Phase slip | Lost pattern |
| Human | Desync | Clock drift | Lost rhythm |
| Cosmic | Disconnect | Causal break | Lost binding |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Phase error bounded and stationary
- [ ] Retention window ≥ recurrence interval
- [ ] Robust to gating and load changes
- [ ] Synchronization metrics stable

Humane tests:
- [ ] Natural rhythm maintained
- [ ] Identity feels continuous
- [ ] Adapts smoothly to change
- [ ] Presence feels stable

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical synchronization nor experiential continuity alone captures its full meaning.
