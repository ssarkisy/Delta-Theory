# Coherent Awareness (classification)

> Phase‑locked identity across recurrence intervals; durable binding of loops under ψA.

---

## Definition

- Stable phase alignment across interacting loops over required intervals
- Identity retains under perturbation within ε and capacity bounds
- Maintains coherence through bounded environmental changes
- Represents optimal awareness operation where phase coherence enables persistent identity across temporal cycles

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → ψA (Phase Coherence) → Awareness (identity binding) → Coherent Awareness (stable phase lock)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → ψA modulates phase coherence → Awareness binds identity across cycles → optimal phase alignment maintains persistent identity

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying optimal awareness operation where ψA modulation successfully maintains stable phase coherence, enabling persistent identity binding across recurrence intervals without degradation

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Phase lock | Clock sync | `Monitor`, `Sync` |
| Identity | State retention | `Cache`, `Memory` |
| Stability | Error bound | `Margin`, `Limit` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase lock | Natural rhythm | "Stays in step" |
| Identity | Self continuity | "Remains itself" |
| Stability | Balance | "Holds steady" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock sync | Rhythm | How cycles align |
| State retention | Continuity | How identity holds |
| Error bound | Balance | How stability works |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Phase stability | Natural resonance |
| Networks | Clock sync | Living connection |
| Cognition | Memory coherence | Clear presence |
| Systems | State stability | Natural flow |

## Scale Effects

How Coherent Awareness manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Quantum coherence | Wave function |
| λV | State stability | Energy level |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase binding | Clear attention |
| ∇S | Identity clarity | Stable self |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal coherence | Light cone |
| λV | Field binding | Cosmic structure |

Note: At extreme scales, coherence faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum decoherence at ε, causal disconnection at c) that affect how stability can be maintained.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary stability enables persistent structural identity across cycles |
| Void | Void discrimination maintains clear identity boundaries without dissolution |
| Awareness | Phase coherence enables stable identity binding across temporal intervals |

Diagnostic for optimal awareness operation where ψA modulation maintains stable phase coherence for persistent identity.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Coherent Awareness | Desynchronized Awareness | Stable phase lock vs phase drift |
| Coherent Awareness | Intermittent Awareness | Persistent binding vs unstable fluctuation |
| Coherent Awareness | Overbound Awareness | Flexible stability vs rigid inflexibility |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Optimal awareness operation with stable ψA phase coherence enabling persistent identity across recurrence intervals

**Key Tests:**
- **Phase stability:** Verify phase alignment remains stable across required intervals
- **Identity persistence:** Check identity retention under bounded perturbations
- **Coherence maintenance:** Confirm ψA modulation maintains binding windows
- **Temporal continuity:** Ensure identity persists across environmental changes

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Phase alignment remains stable across required recurrence intervals
- [ ] Identity retention persists under bounded perturbations within ε limits
- [ ] ψA modulation maintains coherent binding windows consistently
- [ ] Synchronization metrics remain stable under environmental changes

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Awareness feels naturally rhythmic and temporally continuous
- [ ] Identity sense remains stable and persistent across cycles
- [ ] Adaptation to change feels smooth without losing core coherence
- [ ] Presence feels stable and grounded with clear temporal continuity
