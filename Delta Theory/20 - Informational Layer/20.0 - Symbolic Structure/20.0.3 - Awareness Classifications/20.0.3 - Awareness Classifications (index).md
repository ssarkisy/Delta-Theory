# 20.0.3 - Awareness Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes for Awareness (phase/identity coherence via ψA). Observational schema; not kernel.

---

## Module Overview

Awareness Classifications provide diagnostic categories for assessing the coherence and phase behavior of Awareness based on identity persistence and temporal binding properties. These classifications enable systematic evaluation of awareness quality, identifying phase coherence issues, and predicting identity stability behavior.

The classification framework includes:
- **Coherent Awareness:** Stable phase lock with persistent identity across cycles
- **Desynchronized Awareness:** Phase drift causing identity breaks between loops
- **Overbound Awareness:** Over-rigid binding creating inflexible identity
- **Intermittent Awareness:** Unstable binding with identity fluctuation under load

## Content Structure

| Class | Description | Key Diagnostic |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| [[Coherent Awareness (glossary)]] | Stable phase lock | Identity persists across cycles |
| [[Desynchronized Awareness (glossary)]] | Phase drift | Identity breaks between loops |
| [[Overbound Awareness (glossary)]] | Over-rigid binding | Inflexible identity |
| [[Intermittent Awareness (glossary)]] | Unstable binding | Identity flaps under load |

Each classification provides:
- Technical and humane diagnostic criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Phase behavior patterns
- Operational tests
