# 20.0.3 - Awareness Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes for Awareness (phase/identity coherence via ψA). Observational schema; not kernel.

---

## Classes

| Class | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Coherent Awareness (classification)]] | Phase‑locked identity; durable across recurrence intervals |
| [[Desynchronized Awareness (classification)]] | Phase drift; identity cannot bind across loops |
| [[Overbound Awareness (classification)]] | Excessive binding; rigidity; poor adaptability |
| [[Intermittent Awareness (classification)]] | Flapping coherence; on‑off binding under jitter/load |
