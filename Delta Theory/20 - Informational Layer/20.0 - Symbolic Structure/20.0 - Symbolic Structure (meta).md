# 20.0 - Symbolic Structure (meta)

> Hosts canonical terminology and symbols for Delta Theory.

---

## Purpose

Define and stabilize vocabulary (e.g., [[Field]], [[Void]], [[Structure]], [[Awareness]]) for consistent use across the vault.

---

## Modules

- **20.0.0 - Glossary** — glossary entries with aliases and ontological roles

---

## Authoring Guidelines

- Keep entries concise with Definition, Ontological Role, Comparisons, and Related Terms
- Use aliases for plural/common variants

### Ontology vs Diagnostics (clarification)

- Ontological axes: **Structure**, **Void**, **Awareness** (S/V/A)
- Observational diagnostics: **Form** (observable Structure), **Field** (observable Void), **Awareness** (already operational as phase/identity)
- Use “Cognition” only as a domain instance of Awareness, not as a kernel term
