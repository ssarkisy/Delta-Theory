# Bridge / Articulation (pattern)

> Critical connector whose failure isolates regions; key for both propagation and containment.

---

## Definition

- Critical connection point
- Spans network regions
- Controls flow between parts
- Single point of failure

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Critical link | Bridge node | `Monitor`, `Bridge` |
| Flow control | Gate point | `Check`, `Flow` |
| Region span | Network cut | `Test`, `Cut` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Critical link | Key connection | "Only bridge" |
| Flow control | Gateway | "Controls flow" |
| Region span | Joins parts | "Links sides" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bridge node | Key connection | How parts join |
| Gate point | Gateway | How flow controls |
| Network cut | Joins parts | How regions link |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Junction point | Energy gate |
| Networks | Bridge node | Message gate |
| Cognition | Neural bridge | Thought link |
| Systems | Control point | Action gate |

## Scale Effects

How Bridge pattern manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Bridge quantum | Wave gate |
| λV | Gate point | State bridge |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase bridge | Memory link |
| ∇S | Bridge clarity | Clear gate |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Bridge limit | Light gate |
| λV | Field bridge | Space link |

Note: At extreme scales, bridge behavior faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum gates at ε, causal bridges at c).

---

## Invariants / Thresholds

Scale-dependent bounds:
- ε: bridge signal viable
- c: capacity sufficient
- ψA: phase spans bridge
- λV: gate controlled

---

## SVA Coupling

Scale-dependent modulator effects:

| Scale | Modulator | Technical effect | Humane effect |
|-------|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Micro | ∇S | Bridge definition | Gate clarity |
| Human | λV | Flow control | Link control |
| Cosmic | ψA | Phase bridge | Span binding |

---

## Failure Modes

Scale-dependent failure patterns:

| Scale | Mode | Technical signature | Humane signature |
|-------|------|-------------------|------------------|
| Micro | Gate fail | Bridge break | Lost connection |
| Human | Flow block | Link break | Lost passage |
| Cosmic | Span break | Cut forms | Lost binding |

## Diagnostic Checklist

Technical tests:
- [ ] Bridge points found
- [ ] Flow controlled
- [ ] Load monitored
- [ ] Cuts identified

Humane tests:
- [ ] Links feel vital
- [ ] Flow managed
- [ ] Load balanced
- [ ] Parts connected

---

## Design rationale

This diagnostic must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Neither technical bridging nor experiential connection alone captures its full meaning.
