# Cascade (pattern)

> Percolation/chain reaction through the network; local failure or ignition propagates widely.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: small above‑threshold triggers can spread if structure permits
- c: overload amplification along paths

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S: high partitioning reduces cross‑spread or concentrates vulnerability
- λV: lower thresholds enable spread; circuit‑breaking raises them
- ψA: coherence can either contain or synchronize the cascade

---

## Failure Modes

- System‑wide collapse; uncontrolled ignition; fragmentation

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Localize triggers; isolate bridges
- [ ] Raise thresholds (λV) or add redundancy
- [ ] Monitor phase coupling across regions
