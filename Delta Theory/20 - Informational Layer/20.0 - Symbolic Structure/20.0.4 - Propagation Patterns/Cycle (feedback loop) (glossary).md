# Cycle (feedback loop) (glossary)

> Closed path that reinforces stability or oscillation depending on gain and phase.

---

## Definition

- Closed loop with feedback
- Self-reinforcing or self-regulating
- Phase and gain determine behavior
- Stability depends on margins
- Represents network topology diagnostic for identifying closed-loop feedback structures where flow returns to its origin, creating self-reinforcing or self-regulating dynamics

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Flow (propagation) → Recursive closure → Cycle (closed-loop feedback)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Flow enables propagation → Network structures create closed paths → Flow returns to origin creating feedback loops with self-reinforcing or self-regulating dynamics

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying closed-loop network topologies where flow propagation returns to its origin, creating recursive feedback dynamics that can either stabilize (negative feedback) or amplify (positive feedback) depending on phase and gain relationships

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Loop closure | Feedback path | `Monitor`, `Loop` |
| Phase lock | Cycle sync | `Check`, `Phase` |
| Gain control | Level adjust | `Tune`, `Gain` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Loop closure | Coming back | "Returns home" |
| Phase lock | Natural rhythm | "In sync" |
| Gain control | Response level | "Right amount" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Feedback path | Coming back | How cycles close |
| Cycle sync | Natural rhythm | How timing works |
| Level adjust | Response level | How balance forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Resonator | Natural cycle |
| Networks | Echo loop | Message cycle |
| Cognition | Memory loop | Thought cycle |
| Systems | Process cycle | Action loop |

## Scale Effects

How Cycle pattern manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Loop quantum | Wave cycle |
| λV | Gate cycle | State loop |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase binding | Memory cycle |
| ∇S | Loop clarity | Clear pattern |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Loop limit | Light cycle |
| λV | Field cycle | Space loop |

Note: At extreme scales, cycle behavior faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum cycles at ε, causal loops at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary closure enables structural feedback and recursive stabilization |
| Void | Void circulation allows controlled feedback flow and self-regulation |
| Awareness | Phase cycling enables coherent recursive identity and memory formation |

Diagnostic for closed-loop network topology where flow propagation returns to origin, creating recursive feedback dynamics for stabilization or amplification.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Cycle | Path | Closed loop vs open linear route |
| Cycle | Multi-path | Single feedback loop vs parallel redundancy |
| Cycle | Cascade | Recursive feedback vs amplifying chain reaction |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Closed-loop network topology where flow propagation returns to its origin creating recursive feedback dynamics

**Key Tests:**
- **Loop closure verification:** Confirm flow path returns to its starting point
- **Feedback dynamics assessment:** Check for self-reinforcing or self-regulating behavior
- **Phase and gain analysis:** Measure phase relationships and gain factors determining stability
- **Recursive stability evaluation:** Assess whether feedback creates stabilization or oscillation

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify flow path returns to its starting point (loop closure)
- [ ] Check for self-reinforcing or self-regulating feedback behavior
- [ ] Measure phase relationships and gain factors determining stability
- [ ] Assess whether feedback creates stabilization or oscillation patterns

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Flow feels like it naturally returns and completes its cycle
- [ ] Response feels balanced with appropriate self-regulation
- [ ] Feedback feels controlled and purposeful rather than chaotic
- [ ] Pattern feels complete and naturally self-sustaining
