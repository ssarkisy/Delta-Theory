# Cycle (feedback loop) (pattern)

> Closed path that reinforces stability or oscillation depending on gain and phase.

---

## Invariants / Thresholds (anchors)

- ε: gain above/below threshold determines persistence vs decay
- π: phase geometry across the loop; alignment requirements

---

## SVA Coupling

- ∇S tunes internal differentiation; λV controls external coupling; ψA sets phase lock

---

## Failure Modes

- Limit cycles or chaotic oscillation; drift without lock

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

- [ ] Phase margin sufficient; lock detected
- [ ] Gain within stable window
- [ ] External coupling controlled (λV)
