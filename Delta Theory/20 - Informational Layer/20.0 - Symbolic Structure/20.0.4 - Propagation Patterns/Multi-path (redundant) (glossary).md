# Multi-path (redundant) (glossary)

> Parallel routes provide redundancy and higher resilience.

---

## Definition

- Multiple parallel paths between points
- Independent routes for redundancy
- Load sharing across paths
- Merge reconciliation at endpoints
- Represents network topology diagnostic for identifying parallel propagation routes that provide redundancy, load distribution, and resilience through path diversity

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Flow (propagation) → Network redundancy → Multi-path (parallel route diversity)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Flow enables propagation → Network structures create multiple parallel paths → Redundant routes provide load distribution and resilience through path diversity and merge reconciliation

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying parallel network topologies where multiple independent routes between points provide redundancy, load sharing, and resilience, representing a specific redundancy mode of the foundational Flow pattern with parallel processing dynamics

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Path diversity | Route set | `Monitor`, `Paths` |
| Load balance | Traffic split | `Check`, `Load` |
| Merge sync | State merge | `Sync`, `Merge` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Path diversity | Multiple ways | "Many paths" |
| Load balance | Shared effort | "Split load" |
| Merge sync | Coming together | "All joins up" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Route set | Multiple ways | How diversity works |
| Traffic split | Shared effort | How balance works |
| State merge | Coming together | How unity forms |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Wave paths | Energy spread |
| Networks | Route mesh | Message web |
| Cognition | Neural web | Thought paths |
| Systems | Process web | Action mesh |

## Scale Effects

How Multi-path pattern manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Path quantum | Wave paths |
| λV | Gate mesh | State web |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Path binding | Memory web |
| ∇S | Path clarity | Clear options |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Path limits | Light web |
| λV | Field mesh | Space web |

Note: At extreme scales, multi-path behavior faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum interference at ε, causal webs at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Boundary diversification enables structural resilience through parallel routes |
| Void | Void distribution allows load sharing and redundant flow management |
| Awareness | Phase parallelization enables coherent multi-stream processing and integration |

Diagnostic for parallel network topology where multiple independent routes provide redundancy, load distribution, and resilience through path diversity.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Multi-path | Path | Parallel redundancy vs single linear route |
| Multi-path | Cycle | Parallel routes vs closed feedback loop |
| Multi-path | Bridge/Articulation | Redundant paths vs single critical junction |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Parallel network topology with multiple independent routes providing redundancy, load distribution, and resilience

**Key Tests:**
- **Path independence verification:** Confirm routes are truly independent without hidden dependencies
- **Load distribution assessment:** Check for effective load sharing across parallel paths
- **Merge reconciliation evaluation:** Verify successful integration at convergence points
- **Redundancy effectiveness:** Measure resilience improvement from path diversity

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify routes are truly independent without hidden dependencies or coupling
- [ ] Check for effective load sharing and distribution across parallel paths
- [ ] Verify successful integration and reconciliation at convergence points
- [ ] Measure resilience improvement and redundancy effectiveness from path diversity

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Paths feel genuinely separate and independent from each other
- [ ] Load feels naturally shared and distributed rather than concentrated
- [ ] Integration feels smooth and harmonious at joining points
- [ ] System feels resilient with no single points of failure or vulnerability
