# 20.0.4 - Propagation Patterns (index)

> Observational diagnostics over network structure. "Chains" are paths; patterns capture how difference propagates and fails.

---

## Module Overview

Propagation Patterns provide diagnostic categories for assessing network topology and difference propagation behavior. These patterns enable systematic evaluation of information flow, identifying structural vulnerabilities, and predicting propagation failure modes across network topologies.

The pattern framework includes:
- **Path:** Single-route flow with direct propagation integrity
- **Multi-path:** Parallel routes providing redundancy and diversity
- **Cycle:** Closed loop structures with feedback stability
- **Cascade:** Chain reaction propagation with spread control
- **Bridge:** Critical link structures with articulation points

## Content Structure

| Pattern | Description | Key Diagnostic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [[Path (chain) (glossary)]] | Single-route flow | Path integrity |
| [[Multi-path (redundant) (glossary)]] | Parallel routes | Route diversity |
| [[Cycle (feedback loop) (glossary)]] | Closed loop | Loop stability |
| [[Cascade (glossary)]] | Chain reaction | Spread control |
| [[Bridge - Articulation (glossary)]] | Critical link | Link resilience |

Each pattern provides:
- Technical and humane diagnostic criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Flow behavior patterns
- Stability conditions
