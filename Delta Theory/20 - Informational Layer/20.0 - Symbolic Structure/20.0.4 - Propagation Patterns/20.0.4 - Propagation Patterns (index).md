# 20.0.4 - Propagation Patterns (index)

> Observational diagnostics over network structure. “Chains” are paths; patterns capture how difference propagates and fails.

---

## Patterns

| Pattern | One‑liner |
|---|---|
| [[Path (chain) (pattern)]] | Single‑route propagation along a path |
| [[Multi‑path (redundant) (pattern)]] | Parallel routes provide redundancy/resilience |
| [[Cycle (feedback loop) (pattern)]] | Closed loop reinforces stability or oscillation |
| [[Cascade (pattern)]] | Percolation/chain reaction through network |
| [[Bridge / Articulation (pattern)]] | Critical connector; failure isolates regions |
