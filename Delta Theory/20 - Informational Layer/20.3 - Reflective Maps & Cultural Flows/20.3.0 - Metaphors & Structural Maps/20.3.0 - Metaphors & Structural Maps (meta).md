# 20.3.0 - Metaphors & Structural Maps (meta)

> Container for reflective metaphors, structural diagrams, and system maps that explain the kernel without redefining it.

Scope:
- Keep non-kernel explanatory notes that visualize or narrate the S/V/A triad, constants, and modulators
- Store per-note assets in a local `./_assets/` folder; promote shared visuals to `90 - Assets/`

Suggested contents to group here:
- [[Delta Ontomolecule — Recursive Structural Molecule of ∆‑Theory]]
- [[Cultural Propagation Paths & Writing System Flows in the ∆‑Matrix]]
