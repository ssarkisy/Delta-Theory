# Delta Ontomolecule — Recursive Structural Molecule of ∆‑Theory

> Reflective metaphor: uses molecular language to visualize recursive stabilization. This note is explanatory, not kernel.

---

## Purpose

Make the recursive traceability scaffold legible via a molecular analogy: primitives and constructs as the “core,” modulators as coupling controls, and constants as global stabilizers orbiting the process.

---

## Core Structural Mapping (Molecular Analogy)

| ∆‑Theory Entity | Molecular Analogy | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Primitive / Ontology (∆, R(·), ⊚) | Atom Core | Foundational operators of difference and stabilization. |
| Property / Diagnostic | Atomic Qualifier | Qualifies behavior (e.g., coherence, stability windows). |
| Construct / Form | Functional Pattern | Stabilized shape of difference (structure). |
| Spec / Predicate | Bonding Logic | Closure predicates; boundary/threshold logic. |
| Recursive Construct | Feedback Dynamics | Self‑regulating loops that tune coherence over time. |
| Constants (anchors) | Orbiting Invariants | Global ratios/limits stabilizing propagation across layers. |
| Model Closure | Molecular Cohesion | Cohesive state after thresholds are satisfied. |

## Kernel Anchors — Constants (5)

Conceptual anchors that stabilize modulation across S/V/A. Values live in domain instances.

| Symbol | Conceptual Name                                                                   | One‑line Role                                                |
| ------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| ε      | [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)\|Difference Resolution Quantum]]   | Minimal actionable difference; sets resolution.              |
| π      | [[π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)\|Closure Geometry Ratio]]                 | Closure geometry; rotational/wave structure.                 |
| e      | [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)\|Natural Transformation Rate]]       | Baseline for unconstrained growth/decay.                     |
| φ      | [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)\|Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio]] | Asymmetric partitioning; bias toward absorption/propagation. |
| c      | [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)\|Difference Propagation Limit]]     | Maximum propagation speed through Void.                      |

## Modulators — SVA Triad (not constants)

Coupling controls that regulate propagation; parameterized by the kernel anchors above.

- [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)]] (P+): structural differentiation and boundary sharpening.
- [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]] (P-): receptivity/resonance gate at interfaces.
- [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]] (P0): phase coherence and identity retention.

Global coupling sketch: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$.

## Domain Instances and Non‑Core References

These are useful references but not part of the kernel constants.

- Physics domain anchors (instances, carry values):
  - [[c — Speed of Light in Vacuum (constant)]]
  - [[ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)]]
  - [[α — Fine-Structure Constant (constant)]]
- Math invariants (non‑core references): Euler characteristic (χ), embedding invariance (τ∆)
- Diagnostic property (not a constant): entropy gradient S∆ (emergent unevenness measure)
- Undesignated candidates (out of core unless formalized): κ∆, τ

## Visual Schema

![[delta_ontomolecule_pentagram_full.svg]]

- Core nodes: ∆, R(·), ⊚ → produce [[Form]] via closure.
- Orbitals: ε, π, e, φ, c stabilize feasible regions for closure and coherence.
- Couplers: ∇S / λV / ψA tune differentiation, receptivity, and phase.
- Cohesion: when thresholds are satisfied, recursive feedback yields stable structure.

---

## Implications

- Constants orbit the process (global constraints); modulators operate as controls responding to them.
- Closure is relational completion (a predicate result), not a generative node.
- Traceability chains act like bonds: directioned propagation with evaluable thresholds.

## Tags & Placement

- This is a reflective/semantic mapping: keep under `20.3 - Reflective Maps & Cultural Flows`.
- Tags: `#layer/information`, `#function/observation`, status as appropriate (`seed` → `stable`).
