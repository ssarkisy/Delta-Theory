# 20.3 - Reflective Maps & Cultural Flows (meta)

> Home for reflective, cross-domain mappings and cultural flow notes that contextualize the core but are not part of it.

---

## Purpose

- Capture reflective analyses, cultural mappings, and narrative frameworks linked to the ∆-kernel.
- Keep them out of the kernel while preserving links to [[Structure]], [[Void]], [[Awareness]], constants, and modulators.

---

## Conventions

- Tag with `#layer/information`, `#status/seed|unstable|stable`, `#function/observation`.
- Link core anchors explicitly, e.g. [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]], [[∇S — Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient (Structure)]].
- Treat these as explanatory/reflective artifacts, not specifications.
