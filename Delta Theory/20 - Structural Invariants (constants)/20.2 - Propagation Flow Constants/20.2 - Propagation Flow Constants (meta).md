# 20.3 — Propagation Flow Constants (meta)

## Purpose of This Folder

This section indexes the **Propagation Flow Constants** — structural invariants that modulate **how fast, coherently, and stably difference propagates through relational fields**.

While **Recursive Stabilization Constants (20.0)** govern loop closures, and **Dimensional Embedding Invariants (20.1)** define spatial embedding thresholds, the **Propagation Flow Constants** define:
- The **velocity boundaries** of difference propagation.
- The **dissipation/amplification flow dynamics** across recursive feedback loops.

These constants ensure that difference propagation maintains structural coherence amidst flow dynamics, entropy gradients, and propagation velocity constraints.

## Constants in This Section

|Constant|Structural Role|File|
|---|---|---|
|**Speed of Difference Propagation (c)**|Defines the upper limit velocity at which recursive closure loops can propagate through relational fields while retaining coherence.|[[Speed of Difference Propagation (c) — Recursive Propagation Limit Invariant (constant)]]|
|**Entropy Gradient Constant (S∆)**|Anchors the modulation of dissipation/amplification rates in recursive feedback loops — balancing entropy flow dynamics and stabilization coherence.|[[Entropy Gradient Constant (S∆) — Recursive Dissipation Modulation Invariant (constant)]]|

## Role of Propagation Flow Constants in Delta Theory

|Aspect|Function|
|---|---|
|Velocity Constraints (c)|Ensures difference propagation does not destabilize recursive loops by exceeding relational coherence velocity limits.|
|Dissipation-Amplification Modulation (S∆)|Balances entropy-driven feedback dynamics, preventing recursive loops from collapsing into noise or diverging into runaway amplification.|
|Propagation Timing Alignment|Acts in concert with temporal modulation constants (τ) to synchronize flow dynamics with recursive stabilization cycles.|

Propagation Flow Constants are **recursive modulation anchors** that ensure difference flows remain coherent, stable, and structured as they traverse relational fields under dynamic propagation conditions.

## Traceability Links

|Link|Purpose|
|---|---|
|[[PrimitiveDifference]]|Initiating seed of difference propagation flows.|
|[[RecursiveEmbedding]]|Structuring mechanism of difference propagation across relational layers.|
|[[PropagationDynamicsEvaluator (spec)]]|Formal spec evaluating recursive flow dynamics against c-limit thresholds.|
|[[EntropyModulationPredicate (spec)]]|Formal spec applying S∆ as dissipation/amplification modulation anchor.|
|[[ClosurePropagationOperator (spec)]]|Operator defining closure loop propagation dynamics constrained by c.|
|[[FeedbackDissipationBalancer (spec)]]|Spec balancing recursive loop coherence against entropy flow pressures using S∆.|

## Notes
- Propagation Flow Constants are **not empirical measurements**, but **recursive invariants modulating propagation coherence under velocity and entropy flow conditions**.
- These constants are essential for systems where recursive difference chains interact with **dynamic propagation environments** — ensuring coherence is preserved amidst flow intensities and entropy gradients.
- This section complements **Recursive Stabilization Constants (20.0)** by anchoring **propagation-specific modulation invariants** that stabilize flow dynamics within relational fields.
