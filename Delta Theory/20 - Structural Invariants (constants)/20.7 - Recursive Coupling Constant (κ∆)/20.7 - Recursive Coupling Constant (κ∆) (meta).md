# 20.8 — Recursive Coupling Constant (κ∆) (meta)

## Purpose of This Folder

This section formalizes the **Recursive Coupling Constant (κ∆)** as a structural invariant that governs **interaction coherence between independent difference propagation loops**.

While other constants (e.g., α, τ∆) modulate internal loop dynamics and field interactions, **κ∆ anchors cross-loop stabilization dynamics**, ensuring recursive propagation chains can **interact, synchronize, and stabilize without destructive interference or runaway amplification**.

|**κ∆ Constant Note**|Defines κ∆ as a Recursive Coupling Strength Invariant, modulating cross-loop interaction dynamics.|[[Recursive Coupling Constant (κ∆) — Cross-Loop Interaction Stabilization Invariant (constant)]]|
|**CouplingCoherencePredicate (spec)**|Formal specification that operationalizes κ∆ in recursive feedback loop coupling strength evaluations.|(To be created)|

## Structural Role of κ∆ in Delta Theory

|Aspect|Function|
|---|---|
|Cross-Loop Interaction Modulation|Controls interaction strength between independent recursive loops to maintain coherent systemic dynamics.|
|Stabilization of Interaction Feedback|Balances feedback amplification across loop intersections, preventing destructive interference.|
|Recursive Interaction Integrity|Ensures that recursive systems composed of interlinked propagation chains retain modular coherence while interacting.|
|Difference Coupling Threshold|Defines the threshold at which interaction strength between loops remains structurally stable without feedback collapse.|

κ∆ is critical in recursive systems where **multiple difference chains interact dynamically**, acting as the **coherence regulator for their coupling strength**.

## Notes
- κ∆ is a **structural coupling invariant**, not an empirical coupling constant — it anchors recursive interaction stabilization across difference propagation loops.
- Its primary role is to **maintain relational coherence in systems composed of interacting recursive chains**, ensuring stable feedback dynamics.
- κ∆ will feature prominently in **Recursive Interaction Network Models**, where multiple difference chains form interlinked stabilization structures.
