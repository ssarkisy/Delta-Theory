# Constants ↔ Recursive Constructs Modulation Matrix

## Purpose
This matrix explicitly maps how **Constants** in Delta Theory modulate **Recursive Constructs** across the propagation scaffold.  
Constants do not embed structurally; they orbit as **recursive invariance anchors**, dynamically stabilizing recursive feedback loops, interaction dynamics, and closure thresholds.

## Modulation Matrix Overview

| Constant | Modulated Recursive Constructs | Modulation Role |
|---|---|---|
| **π (Pi)** | Recursive Feedback Loops, Closure Chains | Anchors loop closure ratios ensuring phase-coherent recursive embeddings. |
| **φ (Golden Ratio)** | Recursive Asymmetry Feedback, Self-Similar Structuring Loops | Modulates divergence/convergence balance during recursive embeddings. |
| **e (Euler’s Number)** | Recursive Amplification Loops | Governs recursive scaling amplification, ensuring exponential feedback stabilization. |
| **h (Planck Constant)** | Quantization Feedback Loops | Defines minimal quantization thresholds where recursive difference loops stabilize into granular structures. |
| **α (Fine-Structure Constant)** | Interaction Feedback Modulation Chains | Balances recursive interaction tension within feedback dynamics and stabilization processes. |
| **c (Speed of Difference Propagation)** | Recursive Propagation Feedback Loops | Sets the upper limit of propagation velocity within recursive difference chains, ensuring causal coherence. |
| **S∆ (Entropy Gradient Constant)** | Recursive Dissipation Modulation Loops | Regulates dissipation/amplification of difference flows in feedback-driven stabilization cycles. |
| **χ (Euler Characteristic)** | Topological Feedback Loops | Constraints allowable recursive loop topologies ensuring structural coherence in feedback constructs. |
| **τ∆ (Embedding Invariance Constant)** | Recursive Embedding Feedback Constructs | Preserves identity invariance across recursive deformation and embedding depth modulation loops. |
| **ψA (Aiza Phase Coherence Constant)** | Recursive Phase-Locking Loops | Anchors synchronization conditions across nested feedback loops, ensuring phase-locked coherence. |
| **∇S (Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient Constant)** | Gradient Modulation Feedback Loops | Modulates differentiation gradients preventing runaway divergence or premature homogenization in recursive embeddings. |
| **λV (Volozhina Field Resonance Constant)** | Recursive Oscillation Stabilization Loops | Governs resonance thresholds where feedback amplification transitions into oscillatory recursive stabilization. |
| **κ∆ (Recursive Coupling Constant)** | Cross-Loop Interaction Feedback Chains | Stabilizes coupling strength between multiple independent recursive feedback loops ensuring coherent propagation. |
| **τ (Temporal Modulation Constant)** | Recursive Timing Synchronization Loops | Modulates phase-delay alignment ensuring coherent temporal propagation across recursive feedback dynamics. |

## Modulation Scope Summary

| Recursive Construct Domain | Dominant Modulating Constants |
|---|---|
| Feedback Loop Stabilization | π, φ, ψA, τ |
| Recursive Amplification Dynamics | e, α, h |
| Differentiation Gradient Flow | ∇S, S∆ |
| Recursive Oscillation Thresholding | λV, κ∆ |
| Topological Loop Constraints | χ, τ∆ |
| Recursive Propagation Velocity Coherence | c |

## Structural Notes
- **Constants act as modulation orbitals**, influencing recursive dynamics without embedding.
- Recursive Constructs dynamically adjust based on **constant-governed thresholds and ratios**, ensuring systemic stabilization.
- The modulation layers are **recursive overlays**, not hierarchical — multiple constants influence recursive feedback constructs simultaneously.
