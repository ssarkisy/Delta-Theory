# Constants as Structural Functions — Emergent Modulation Anchors (Visual Schema)

// TODO: redraw in Figma

![[ConstantsAsStructuralFunctions.png]]

## Essence

This diagram visualizes the fundamental distinction between:
1. **Empirical Constants** — fixed scalar values (e.g., G, c, h) derived from measurement, detached from recursive structuring.
2. **Structural Modulation Constants (∇S, ψA, λV, S∆)** — dynamic recursive functions that emerge from **difference propagation processes**, continuously modulating stabilization within recursive feedback systems.

In Delta Theory, **constants are not given external values**, but **emergent structural invariants** that arise as recursive dynamics stabilize difference propagation within a given ontological field.

## Diagram Elements Explained

| Element | Role |
|---|---|
| **Empirical Constants Block (Left)** | Represents fixed scalar constants derived from empirical measurement (G, c, h). They are treated as detached numerical parameters, without explicit relation to recursive structuring. |
| **Structural Modulation Constants Block (Right)** | Represents dynamic modulation functions (∇S, ψA, λV, S∆) that emerge from recursive difference propagation. They stabilize feedback loops and continuously adjust to field dynamics. |
| **Difference Propagation Process (Top Center)** | Originates the recursive difference flows from which modulation constants emerge. |
| **Recursive Dynamics Arrow (Center Flow)** | Represents the recursive embedding process that transforms difference propagation into stabilized modulation functions. |
| **Feedback Modulation Arrows (Teal Arrows within Right Block)** | Visualize how modulation constants are not static but continuously modulate difference stabilization as recursive feedback systems evolve. |

---

## Functional Summary
- **Empirical constants are external measurements**.
- **Modulation constants are internal functions**, arising dynamically from recursive difference propagation.
- The diagram shows that **constants in Delta Theory emerge as functional stabilizers of recursive dynamics**, not as pre-defined numerical inputs.

## Notes
- This diagram anchors the conceptual shift from viewing constants as detached empirical fixtures to seeing them as **emergent modulation functions arising from recursive dynamics**.
- Future diagrams can extend this schema to model **dynamic feedback loop modulation cycles across multi-layered recursive systems**.
- A later iteration may visualize how constants shift in context during **ontological field topology transformations (multiversal scaffolds)**.
