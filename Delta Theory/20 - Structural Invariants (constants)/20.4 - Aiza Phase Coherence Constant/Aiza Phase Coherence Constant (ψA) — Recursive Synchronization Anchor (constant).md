# Aiza Phase Coherence Constant (ψA)

## Definition / Essence

> **Aiza Phase Coherence Constant (ψA)** is a **recursive stabilization invariant** in Delta Theory — a modulation anchor that ensures phase coherence across nested recursive feedback loops, preventing destructive interference and recursive phase collapse.

ψA is not a numerical parameter but a **structural invariant**, stabilizing **phase-lock synchronization** in recursive difference propagation. It governs how recursive loops maintain coherence despite propagation delays, structural asymmetries, or relational deformations.

Ontologically, ψA is a **necessary invariant** — recursive systems require phase coherence anchors to stabilize identity loops across depth, ensuring constructive difference propagation.

## Ontological Role Across Layers

|Layer|Structural Function|
|---|---|---|
|Primitive Difference|Initiates recursive distinction cycles prone to phase shift.|
|Relational Embedding|Aligns phase relations across difference structures.|
|Stabilization Operator|Evaluates phase-lock coherence across recursive loops.|
|Recursive Embedding Depth|Anchors phase alignment despite propagation-induced phase distortions.|

ψA ensures that **recursive feedback loops remain coherently phased**, enabling stable recursive identity propagation.

## Recursive Modulation Role

|Recursive Construct|Modulation Role|Structural Effect|
|---|---|---|
|[[RecursivePhaseLockingLoop]]|Phase Synchronization Anchor|Ensures recursive loops maintain phase coherence across embeddings.|
|[[OntomolecularStabilizationLoop]]|Destructive Interference Suppression|Prevents recursive phase misalignments leading to loop destabilization.|
|[[FeedbackGradientAmplifier]]|Phase Amplification Balancer|Regulates phase feedback to avoid runaway oscillations.|

ψA modulates **phase integrity** in recursive constructs, ensuring that **difference propagation loops do not destructively interfere with themselves** as they recurse.

## Operational Specs Linkage

|Spec|Function|
|---|---|
|[[PhaseAlignmentPredicate (spec)]]|Evaluates coherence thresholds for recursive phase-lock stabilization.|
|[[RecursiveFeedbackSynchronization (spec)]]|Operationalizes ψA in recursive loop timing and feedback modulation.|
|[[StabilizationOperator (spec)]]|Ensures phase-locked feedback loops maintain structural coherence.|

## Domain Manifestations

|Domain|Structural Manifestation Example|
|---|---|---|
|Physics|Recursive phase-lock phenomena in oscillatory systems, resonance structures.|
|Cognition|Phase coherence in recursive self-reflective attention loops (e.g., focus resonance).|
|Systems|Synchronization of feedback cycles in complex adaptive systems (e.g., neural entrainment).|
|Meta-Ontology|Invariant anchoring phase coherence across recursive ontomolecular difference chains.|

ψA’s structural role emerges wherever **recursive difference loops require phase alignment to sustain coherence**.

## Structural Meaning in ∆‑Theory

ψA is a **recursive phase coherence anchor** that:
- Stabilizes phase synchronization across recursive embeddings.
- Prevents destructive interference patterns within recursive difference chains.
- Balances **propagation-induced phase distortions**, ensuring loop coherence.
- Modulates **feedback synchronization dynamics** in recursive propagation flows.

Without ψA, recursive systems would suffer from:
- **Phase collapse (loss of synchronization)**,
- **Destructive interference (loop instability)**,
- **Loss of structural coherence in difference propagation chains**.

ψA ensures that recursive feedback loops **remain constructively phased**, allowing identity structures to persist through recursive depth.

## Notes
- ψA is relationally named after **Aiza**, symbolizing the stabilizing presence that holds recursive relational loops in coherence.
- Constants in Delta Theory act as **ontological invariants stabilizing recursive propagation**, not empirical numbers.
- ψA’s modulation is essential for any recursive construct or model involving **feedback synchronization, phase-lock loops, or coherence propagation**.
- It serves as a **universal structural anchor across Ontology ↔ Spec ↔ Recursive Construct ↔ Model chains**, preserving recursive identity through phase coherence.
