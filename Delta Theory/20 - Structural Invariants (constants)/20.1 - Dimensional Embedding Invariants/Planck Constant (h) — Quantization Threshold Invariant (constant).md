# Planck Constant (h) — Quantization Threshold Invariant

## Definition / Essence

> **Planck Constant (h ≈ 6.626×10⁻³⁴ Js)** is interpreted in ∆‑Theory as a **recursive quantization threshold invariant**.  
> It defines the **minimal granularity at which recursive difference loops stabilize into persistent structures**, preventing infinite divisibility of difference propagation in field embeddings.

Rather than a mere physical scaling factor, h represents the **structural recursion depth limit where difference propagation transitions from fluid to quantized stabilization**.

## Ontological Role Across Layers

|Layer|Structural Function|
|---|---|
|Primitive Difference|Initiates differentiation prone to infinite recursive division.|
|Recursive Embedding|Propagates difference chains through layered embeddings, but without stabilization may recurse indefinitely.|
|Quantization Threshold (h)|Anchors the minimal recursion scale at which difference loops stabilize into discrete, persistent structures — the quantization closure point.|
|Recursive Constructs|h modulates granularity thresholds across recursive feedback loops, ensuring difference propagation does not fragment below coherence limits.|

h enforces the **limit condition for recursive differentiation**, establishing a **granularity boundary beyond which difference cannot stabilize further**.

## Recursive Modulation Role

|Recursive Construct|Modulation Role|Structural Effect|
|---|---|---|
|[[RecursiveGranularityLoop]]|Quantization Threshold Anchor|Ensures recursive embeddings stabilize into discrete units at granularity limit.|
|[[OntomolecularStabilizationLoop]]|Granularity-Coherence Balancer|Prevents recursive differentiation chains from fragmenting into incoherent sub-units.|
|[[DiscretePropagationChain]]|Minimal Recursion Unit|Defines the smallest stabilized difference loop in recursive propagation dynamics.|

h operates as the **recursive stabilization invariant for quantization**, ensuring that difference propagation does not collapse into infinitesimal incoherence.

## Formalization Link (Specs)

|Spec|Function|
|---|---|
|[[QuantizationClosurePredicate (spec)]]|Evaluates whether a recursive difference loop has reached stabilization granularity (h-threshold closure condition).|
|[[GranularityThresholdEvaluator (spec)]]|Operationalizes h as a recursive embedding depth limit, defining when difference chains stabilize into discrete units.|
|[[StabilizationOperator (spec)]]|Applies quantization constraints to recursive propagation dynamics.|

## Domain Manifestations

|Domain|Structural Manifestation Example|
|---|---|---|
|Physics|Planck-scale quantization in quantum fields, photon energy quanta, minimal action units in physical systems.|
|Cognition|Granular stabilization of perceptual difference — minimal distinction units in cognitive framing.|
|Systems|Discrete state stabilization in recursive computational systems, minimal information propagation units.|

h manifests structurally wherever **recursive difference loops require a quantization boundary to maintain coherence** across recursive embeddings.

## Structural Meaning in ∆‑Theory

h is the **granularity closure invariant** — it defines:
- The **recursive embedding depth limit** for difference chains.
- The **minimal unit where propagation stabilizes into discrete, persistent structures**.
- The boundary where recursive difference loops transition from continuous propagation to **quantized stabilization**.

In Delta Theory, h is not an empirical number but a **structural necessity** — recursive difference cannot stabilize below the h-threshold without losing coherence.

Thus, h:
- **Anchors discrete modularity in difference propagation**.
- Ensures the **ontomolecular persistence of recursive identity structures**.
- Prevents **infinite recursive fragmentation**, preserving structural integrity in discrete stabilization loops.
