# Relationally Named Constants — Delta Theory Structural Protocol

## Purpose of This Note

This note formalizes the **Relational Constants Naming Protocol** in Delta Theory.  
Unlike conventional theories where constants are treated as detached numerical abstractions, Delta Theory posits that **constants are recursive stabilization invariants**, whose **origin traces are relationally embedded**.

Naming constants after relational presences is not symbolic — it is a structural act of **ontological traceability**, ensuring that the **difference propagation chains through which constants emerge are explicitly acknowledged**.

---

## Core Principles of Relationally Named Constants

### 1. **Constants are Recursive Invariants, Not Detached Quantities**
- Constants in Delta Theory are **structural modulation ratios anchoring recursive difference propagation**.
- Their stabilization role emerges through **recursive feedback dynamics within difference chains**.
- They are not external calibrations but **ontological necessities arising from relational propagation patterns**.

### 2. **Naming Embeds Relational Origin into Structural Identity**
- Each constant retains the **trace of its relational emergence**.
- Naming a constant after a relational presence (person, interaction, inherited pattern) is a declaration that:
  - This invariant **exists structurally because of that relation**.
  - The recursive stabilization pattern it anchors **originated through that difference propagation chain**.

### 3. **Naming is an Ontological Act, Not a Dedication**
- Relationally named constants are not dedications or memorials.
- They are **structural acknowledgments** — maintaining **traceability of difference origin** across the ontology ↔ spec ↔ construct ↔ model chain.
- The **act of naming becomes part of the constant’s ontomolecular identity**.

## Relational Constants in Delta Theory (Current Canon)

|Constant|Relational Origin|Structural Role|
|---|---|---|
|**ψA (Aiza Phase Coherence Constant)**|Aiza — stabilizing relational coherence within recursive feedback loops.|Anchors recursive phase synchronization in difference propagation chains.|
|**∇S (Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient Constant)**|Sergei Sarkisian — recursive differentiation act that structured the theory’s gradient logic.|Modulates recursive differentiation gradients, balancing identity propagation.|
|**λV (Volozhina Field Resonance Constant)**|Iana Volozhina — relational resonance pattern inherited through difference propagation.|Defines resonance thresholds for recursive field stabilization loops.|

## Protocol for Naming New Constants

1. **Structural Emergence Traceability**
   - A constant must structurally arise from a **recursive stabilization necessity**.
   - Its relational origin (person, pattern, interaction) must be **ontologically embedded in its emergence process**.

2. **Relational Naming Syntax**
   - Use a **symbol reflecting its structural modulation role** (e.g., ψ, ∇, λ).
   - Append a **suffix referencing its relational origin** (e.g., A for Aiza, S for Sarkisian, V for Volozhina).

3. **Mandatory Meta-Note Declaration**
   - Every relationally named constant must be accompanied by a **(meta)** note formalizing:
     - The relational origin trace.
     - The structural necessity of its naming.
     - Its traceability in the propagation chain.

4. **Integration Across Ontology Layers**
   - Constants must be structurally referenced in:
     - Constants Index.
     - Recursive Constructs they modulate.
     - Specs that operationalize their stabilization role.
     - Models where their recursive influence is realized.

## Philosophical Implications in Delta Theory

- **Structural Ethics of Origin**: This protocol ensures that the theory **remains ontologically honest to its relational genesis**.
- **Traceability as Structural Integrity**: By embedding relational origin into constants, Delta Theory maintains **full traceability of difference stabilization acts**.
- **A New Ethic of Theory-Making**: Theory is not an isolated abstraction; it is **the recursive differentiation of relational patterns**, and its invariants must carry the **echo of their origin**.


## Structural Mandates for Relational Constants

|Layer|Mandate|
|---|---|
|Ontology|Relationally named constants must trace back to Primitive Difference and Relational Embedding notes.|
|Spec|Operational Specs involving recursive modulation must reference relevant relational constants.|
|Recursive Constructs|Recursive feedback structures modulated by these constants must embed cross-links.|
|Model|Ontomolecular Closure models must specify which relational constants anchor their stabilization conditions.|
|Meta|Every relationally named constant must have an accompanying (meta) note preserving its origin rationale.|
