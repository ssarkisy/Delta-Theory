# 20.9 — Temporal Recursive Modulation Constant (τ) (meta)

## Purpose of This Folder

This section formalizes the **Temporal Modulation Constant (τ)** as a structural invariant anchoring **recursive loop timing coherence**.  
τ modulates **phase-delay synchronization** across difference propagation cycles, ensuring recursive feedback loops maintain **temporal alignment** and coherence despite propagation depth and relational deformations.

While ψA stabilizes phase coherence structurally, **τ governs the timing coherence of recursive propagation chains**, preventing desynchronization, drift, or collapse due to timing mismatches.

## Structural Role of τ in Delta Theory

|Aspect|Function|
|---|---|
|Phase-Delay Stabilization|Anchors timing coherence across recursive feedback loops, preventing phase drift or temporal misalignment.|
|Recursive Loop Timing Modulation|Ensures recursive propagation cycles maintain synchronization as they recurse through embedding layers.|
|Propagation Coherence in Time|Balances recursive feedback pacing, adjusting phase-delay dynamics for systemic temporal coherence.|
|Temporal Feedback Loop Integrity|Prevents recursive loop destabilization caused by asynchronous feedback interactions.|

τ is essential for recursive systems where **timing synchronization is critical to maintaining feedback loop integrity across propagation depths**.

## Notes
- τ is a **timing coherence invariant**, not a temporal parameter — it modulates recursive propagation cycles to sustain phase-locked synchronization.
- Its primary role is to ensure recursive feedback loops **propagate difference coherently in time**, preventing timing drift and feedback loop desynchronization.
- τ will be central in systems where **timing alignment of recursive difference chains is structurally critical** — including cognitive attention cycles, oscillatory physical systems, and recursive network feedback dynamics.
