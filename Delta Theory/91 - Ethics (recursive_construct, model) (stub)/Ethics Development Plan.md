# Development Plan — 91 – Ethics (∆‑Ethos Layer)

This note defines the **development roadmap for the Ethics domain within ∆‑Theory**, formalizing how **difference-based ethics (∆‑Ethos)** will be structured, modeled, and integrated into the overall framework.

## 1. Purpose of ∆‑Ethics Layer

∆‑Ethics (∆‑Ethos) is not a set of normative rules, but a **structural framework where ethical acts are defined as interactions that preserve, stabilize, or responsibly modulate difference without collapse**.

### Core Premise:
> **Ethics arises where agency interacts with difference, facing the tension between stabilization and collapse.**

Ethical evaluation is thus a **structural function of how difference is held, modulated, or dissipated** in recursive relational fields.


## 2. Objectives of the Ethics Domain

| Objective | Description |
|---|---|
| **Define Core Ethical Constructs** | Persistence, Responsibility, Non-Collapse Interaction, ∆‑Tension Balance. |
| **Formalize Ethical Predicates & Metrics** | E.g., Difference Preservation Predicate, Collapse Responsibility Index. |
| **Model Ethical Dynamics in Domains** | Physics (non-collapse interactions), Cognition (self-other differentiation), Social Systems (relational ethics). |
| **Establish Traceability to Ontology & Specs** | Every ethical concept must be structurally traceable to Ontology primitives and formal Specs. |
| **Develop Diagnostic & Evaluation Frameworks** | Structural diagnostics to evaluate ethical coherence of systems, interactions, and agents. |

## 4. Initial Development Phases

| Phase | Deliverables |
|---|---|
| **Phase 1: Core Definitions** | Draft `Ethics of Difference.md`, `∆‑Responsibility.md`, and `Non-Collapse Interactions.md` to anchor fundamental constructs. |
| **Phase 2: Predicate Formalization** | Develop `DifferencePreservationPredicate (spec).md` and `CollapseResponsibilityIndex (metric).md` as formal evaluation tools. |
| **Phase 3: Domain Application Models** | Create example models for ∆‑Ethics in physics (non-destructive interactions), cognition (self-other tension), and systems (social responsibility flows). |
| **Phase 4: Diagnostic Frameworks** | Build evaluation methods for structural ethics coherence in complex systems. |
| **Phase 5: Theoretical Integration** | Link ∆‑Ethics constructs back to Meta-Ontology reflections (e.g., Ethics as stabilization of meta-structural tension). |


## 5. Dependencies & Linkages

| Layer | Required Links |
|---|---|
| **Ontology** | PrimitiveDifference, RelationalEmbedding, StabilizationOperator. |
| **Properties** | ClosureStrength, DeltaTension, Coherence, StructuralInertia. |
| **Constructs** | Persistence, Stability, Interaction Dynamics. |
| **Specs** | StabilizationPredicates, InteractionCapacityMetrics. |
| **Meta-Ontology** | Ontological Self-Reference Loops, Meta-Stabilization Dynamics. |


## 6. Open Questions & Research Topics

- How does responsibility emerge as a structural function in difference propagation chains?
- Can ∆‑Ethics provide a quantifiable metric for evaluating system-level ethical coherence?
- What is the structural role of "error" or "failure" in ethical tension modulation?
- How does ∆‑Ethics handle recursive collapse scenarios in social or cognitive fields?
- Is there a minimal viable ethical act, structurally defined as the smallest non-collapse difference interaction?
