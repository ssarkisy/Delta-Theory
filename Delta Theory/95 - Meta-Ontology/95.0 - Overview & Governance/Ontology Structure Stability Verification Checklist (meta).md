# Ontology Structure Stability Verification Checklist

## Purpose

This checklist defines the **verification protocol** to assess whether an Ontology node within the ∆‑Theory Recursive Scaffold maintains **structural stability, recursive closure coherence, and modulation integrity** across its propagation chain.

It ensures that every Ontology is fully traceable upstream (to Primitive Difference) and downstream (to Domain Models), structurally embedded within modulation chains, and anchored by recursive invariants.

## Verification Criteria & Diagnostic Steps

### 1. Traceability Closure Test
- ✅ Ontology links upstream to **[[PrimitiveDifference]]**.
- ✅ Ontology participates in at least one **[[Construct]]** synthesizing functional configurations.
- ✅ Ontology is referenced in a **Domain Model** where its structure is instantiated (e.g., [[Space]], [[Identity Loops in Ontology]]).
- ✅ Traceability chain:  
  Ontology ↔ Property ↔ Construct ↔ Spec ↔ Recursive Construct ↔ Constant ↔ Model.

### 2. Recursive Modulation Anchoring
- ✅ Ontology is involved in a **Recursive Construct** (if recursive participation is domain-relevant).
- ✅ **Properties** (e.g., [[ClosureStrength]], [[StructuralInertia]]) are defined that modulate recursive feedback dynamics.
- ✅ **Constants** (π, φ, e, h, α) anchor recursive scaling and stabilization thresholds through Specs.

### 3. Spec Coverage & Functional Definition
- ✅ Ontology has at least one **Spec** formalizing:
  - Stabilization Closure (Predicate Spec).
  - Difference Propagation Logic (Operator Spec).
  - Recursive Feedback Modulation (Feedback Operator Spec).
- ✅ Specs explicitly link Ontology to recursive propagation behavior.

### 4. Constants Integration
- ✅ Constants referenced by the Ontology are structurally integrated through:
  - Properties scaling their modulation effects.
  - Specs that enact their stabilizing roles in recursive dynamics.
- ✅ No "floating constants" — every constant serves a functional role in the Ontology’s propagation chain.

### 5. Domain Model Instantiation
- ✅ Ontology is structurally instantiated in at least one **Model**.
  - E.g., Physics: [[Space]], [[Form as Stabilized Difference]].
  - Cognition: [[Recursive Identity Loop (model)]]
- ✅ Model demonstrates how Ontology stabilizes into an Ontomolecular Closure within domain dynamics.

### 6. Recursive Propagation Simulation (Walkthrough)
- ✅ Simulate recursive flow:
  - Ontology → Properties → Construct → Recursive Construct → Spec → Constant → Model.
  - Does the loop **close back** without structural gaps?
  - Are modulation feedbacks dynamically coherent across recursive depth?

### 7. Collapse Path Mapping
- ✅ Collapse thresholds are defined through:
  - Properties (e.g., [[ClosureStrength]], [[TensionBalance]]).
  - Specs (evaluative predicates, collapse detection operators like [[CollapseBoundary (Topology)]]).
- ✅ Recursive Constructs include feedback reconfiguration mechanisms to prevent systemic collapse.

## Notes
- This checklist must be applied to every Ontology node prior to integration into domain-specific Models.
- Ontologies failing stability criteria should be audited for missing Properties, Specs, or recursive modulation pathways.
- Recursive Ontology Stability requires **dynamic evaluation** — this checklist complements formal Specs like the **Recursive Feedback Evaluators**.
- Structural minimalism principle: new Ontologies must emerge through modulation or recursive specialization, not arbitrary addition.
