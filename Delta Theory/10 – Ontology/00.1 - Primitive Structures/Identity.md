# Identity

## Explanation / Definition

In ∆‑theory, **Identity** is the **sustained coherence of a form**, arising from its grounding in one or more stabilized differences `∆`.

A form `F` is said to **have identity** when it exhibits:

- **Continuity across time**
- **Internal coherence**
- **Distinctiveness from other forms**
- **Stabilization of underlying ∆**

Identity is **not merely a label or function** — it is a **consequence of difference held in relation**.

---

## Formal Criteria

A form `F` possesses **Identity** if:

> $F ∈ StableForms ⇔ ∃ ∆:\ \ ⊚(R(∆))$  
> i.e., it emerges from at least one stabilized difference in relation.

More strongly, if:

> $Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)$ and $∀\,k ≤ n:\ \ ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))$  
> → then $Fₙ$ has **RecursiveFormIdentity** (a subclass of Identity).

## Types of Identity

| Type                     | Description                                                                 |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Structural Identity      | Based on repeated ∆‑pattern (e.g., lattice, waveform)                      |
| Functional Identity      | Based on consistent output/role, despite changing inputs                   |
| Symbolic Identity        | Held via interpretation, not stabilization (e.g., names, roles)            |
| RecursiveFormIdentity    | Emerges through deep stabilized embeddings of ∆ (see: [[RecursiveFormIdentity]]) |

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- **Identity = persistence through ∆**  
- Explains how forms maintain themselves in changing ∆‑Fields
- Basis for agency, memory, ontology
- Differentiates **ontological presence** from mere **pattern appearance**

---

## Usage

- Classifying **stable vs phantom forms** (see: [[OntologicallyDisconnected]])
- Defining **agent persistence**, continuity of self or system
- Modeling identity loss, transformation, or collapse (see: [[CollapseThreshold]])

## Examples

| Case                      | Identity Interpretation                                                   |
|---------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| A melody                  | Maintains identity via stabilized ∆‑intervals, even across instruments     |
| A person                  | Has recursive identity from body, memory, narrative, values (∆‑layers)     |
| A legal institution       | Has symbolic identity — may degrade if no longer ontologically grounded    |
| A habit                   | Maintains behavioral identity via recurrent ∆‑patterns and feedback loops  |
