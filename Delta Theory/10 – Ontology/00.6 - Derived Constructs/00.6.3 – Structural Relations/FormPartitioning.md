# Formal Partitioning of Forms in FRONT

## Definition

Let `Fₙ` denote a form at level *n* defined recursively as:

> `Fₙ := ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`

We define the total set of **form-like entities** as:

> `AllForms = {F | F is structurally expressible via relational difference R(∆) or mimics such structure}`

This set is partitioned into **four disjoint subsets**:

---

### 1. StableForms

**Definition**:
A form `Fₙ` belongs to `StableForms` iff all levels of relational difference are stabilized.

> `Fₙ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ∀ j ∈ [0, n]: ⊚(Rʲ(∆₀)) holds`

These are fully coherent, recursively grounded forms.

---

### 2. ApparentForms

**Definition**:
A form `Fₙ` belongs to `ApparentForms` iff it appears coherent at level *n*, but some lower level *k < n* fails to stabilize.

> `Fₙ ∈ ApparentForms ⇔ ∃ k < n: ¬⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀)) ∧ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)) holds`

These are ontologically unstable but functionally present.

---

### 3. CollapsedForms

**Definition**:
A form `Fₙ` belongs to `CollapsedForms` iff no stabilization holds at any level up to *n*.

> `Fₙ ∈ CollapsedForms ⇔ ∀ j ∈ [0, n]: ¬⊚(Rʲ(∆₀))`

These are degenerated or disintegrated forms.

---

### 4. PseudoForms

**Definition**:
A structure `P` belongs to `PseudoForms` iff it appears to be a form but is not generated by relational difference.

> `P ∈ PseudoForms ⇔ ∄ ∆ such that P = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆)) for any n`

These are simulations of form without ontological grounding (i.e., without ∆).

---

### Logical Properties

* **Mutual Exclusivity**:

  > `∀ X ≠ Y ∈ {StableForms, ApparentForms, CollapsedForms, PseudoForms}: X ∩ Y = ∅`

* **Partial Exhaustiveness**:

  > `ExpressedForms = StableForms ∪ ApparentForms ∪ CollapsedForms`

* **Full Ontological Partition**:

  > `AllForms = ExpressedForms ∪ PseudoForms`

### Interpretive Table

| Category       | Stabilized?  | Coherent? | Ontologically Grounded? | Persistent? |
| -------------- | ------------ | --------- | ----------------------- | ----------- |
| StableForms    | ✅ All levels | ✅ Yes     | ✅ Yes                   | ✅ Yes       |
| ApparentForms  | ❌ Some fail  | ✅ Yes     | ⚠️ Partial              | ⚠️ Fragile  |
| CollapsedForms | ❌ None       | ❌ No      | ❌ No                    | ❌ No        |
| PseudoForms    | ❌ N/A        | ⚠️ Mimics | ❌ No                    | ⚠️ Unstable |

### Use Cases

* Formal analysis of form states in recursive ∆‑structured systems
* Diagnosis of hidden instability (ApparentForms)
* Detection of superficial or false coherence (PseudoForms)
* Modeling of systemic collapse or recovery processes
