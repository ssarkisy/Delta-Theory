# Loop(Fₙ) — Recursive Closure of Form

## Explanation / Definition

**Loop(Fₙ)** refers to a **recursive return** of a stabilized difference to its own generative origin. A form $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ is said to loop when its internal structure **feeds back** into the initiating difference — forming a **closed ∆‑circuit**.

> $Loop(Fₙ) ⇔ Fₙ ⊚→ ∆₀$  
> i.e., the form reactivates or encloses its own generative difference.

This creates a **self-contained**, **resonant**, and often **mass-generating** configuration — in contrast to open, radiative forms.

## Ontological Role

Looped forms are:

- **Persistent** — they maintain ontological presence  
- **Internally coherent** — recursive tensions reinforce rather than disperse  
- **Mass-generating** — looped ∆ confers inertial resistance to change  

---

## Formal Requirements

Let $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$.

Then:

$Loop(Fₙ)$ exists if:

- There is a path: $Fₙ → ∆₀′$  
- And $∆₀′ ≈ ∆₀$ under stabilization

This defines a **closed relational trajectory** in ∆-space — akin to a **topological loop** or **resonant echo**.

| System             | Loop(Fₙ)?     | Interpretation                                     |
|--------------------|----------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Photon             | ❌ No          | ∆ propagates freely, no recursive return           |
| Electron           | ✅ Minimal     | Single-level recursive closure                     |
| Proton             | ✅ Deep        | Multi-layered stable loop across sub-∆ structure   |
| Feedback circuit   | ✅ Yes         | Logic pattern reinforces its initial difference    |
| Trauma loop        | ✅ Yes         | Recurrent unresolved ∆ encoded as stable cognition |

## Topological View

- $Loop(Fₙ)$ implies **non-trivial topology** in the space of stabilized differences  
- Can be represented as a **closed trajectory**, **fixed-point attractor**, or **limit cycle** within ∆‑flows

## Summary

> $Loop(Fₙ)$ is where difference returns home.  
> It marks the emergence of **ontologically stable forms** — the ones that stay, persist, and resist dissolution.
