# Depth(Fₙ) — Recursive Depth of Form

## Explanation / Definition

**Depth(Fₙ)** measures the number of recursive relational embeddings $Rⁿ(∆₀)$ required to produce and stabilize a form $Fₙ$.

It quantifies the **ontological depth** of a form — how many **nested differences** are stabilized in order to maintain its coherence.

> If $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$, then:  
> $Depth(Fₙ) = n$

---

## Ontological Status

- **Irreducible** attribute — not observable from surface behavior alone  
- **Structural** — reflects the construction path, not outward appearance  
- Marks how far a form is removed from the **primitive seed** $∆₀$

---

## Role in ∆‑Theory

Depth plays a critical role in characterizing:

- [[PotentialEnergy]] — deeper forms store more ∆-tension  
- [[StructuralInertia]] — resistance to change increases with depth  
- [[RestorationChain]] — recovery requires traversing all embedded layers  

Distinguishes **shallow forms** (quick to shift or collapse) from **deep forms** (resilient but inertial).

---

## Dependencies

- Form must be constructed as:  
  $Fₙ = ⊚(R(R(...(R(∆₀)))))$, with $n$ layers  
- Each level assumed to be stabilized under $⊚$

---

## Related Concepts

- [[Form]] — stabilized result of recursive embedding  
- [[PotentialEnergy]] — increases with $Depth(Fₙ)$  
- [[DeltaTension]] — spans and sustains recursive layers  
- [[RestorationChain]] — mechanism of recovery through nested forms  
- [[FormCollapse]] — occurs when any depth layer fails stabilization  

---

## Usage

- Proxy for **semantic complexity** or **structural thickness**  
- Used to model systems where **depth = resilience + cost**  
- Explains phenomena like:
  - Deep trauma → more persistent cognitive loop  
  - Deep beliefs → greater resistance to change  
  - Deep architectures → robustness at the price of fragility in recovery

## Examples / Case Studies

| Domain        | $Depth(Fₙ)$ Represents                          |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| Physics       | Layers of field interaction → stable matter     |
| Cognition     | Identity structures or belief systems           |
| Language      | Sentences with nested clauses or meaning layers |
| Software      | Deeply nested abstraction layers in architecture |
| Memory        | Long chains of associative abstraction          |

## Formal Expression

Let $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$

Then:

> $Depth(Fₙ) = n$  
> The **ontological complexity** of a form is equal to the number of **stabilized recursive differences** it holds.

## Summary

> Depth is not how far something is **from view**,  
> but how far it is **from origin** — and how much ∆ it carries along the way.
