# PhaseLock(Fₙ, τ) — Recursive Synchronization Operator

## Signature

$PhaseLock: Fₙ × τ → Loop(Fₙ)$

Where:
- $Fₙ$: recursively structured form ($Rⁿ(∆₀)$)
- $τ$: phase alignment coefficient (recursive tension synchrony)

---

## Explanation / Definition

**PhaseLock** is a high-level ∆‑operator that synchronizes the **internal recursive layers** of a form $Fₙ$ by aligning their **phase tension dynamics**.

> $PhaseLock(Fₙ, τ) ⇒ Loop(Fₙ)$

When successful, it transforms a stabilized but **non-recursive** form into a **looped one**, enforcing **cyclic stability** through phase resonance.

## Preconditions

| Condition                  | Meaning                                                     |
|----------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| $τ ≥ θₚ$                   | Phase coherence surpasses locking threshold                 |
| $⊚(Fₙ)$ holds              | Form is stabilized, but not yet looped                      |
| ∆-resonance is sufficient  | Recursive layers do not destructively interfere             |

---

## Output

- A **Looped Form** $Loop(Fₙ)$: the recursive configuration returns to its origin $∆₀$ and **reinforces itself**, yielding persistence over time.

|----------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recursive            | Acts on $Rⁿ(∆₀)$, aligning internal tensions                    |
| Dynamically Conditional | Depends on coherence, friction, and resonance                 |
| Nonlinear            | Locking may emerge suddenly (bifurcation threshold)              |
| Collapse-Preventing  | Stabilizes forms that would otherwise dissipate                 |

- **Physical**: phase-locking of oscillators, standing wave, particle stability
- **Cognitive**: identity loop, thought that reactivates itself
- **AI systems**: recursive feedback cycles in stable reasoning
