# ∆‑Dissonance

## Definition

**∆‑Dissonance** is the state of **relational instability** that arises when multiple difference-based propagations **interact incoherently**, disrupting the stabilization process ($⊚$) and leading to form breakdown.

It is the **inverse of ∆‑resonance** — not a unifying coherence, but a destructive clash of propagating structures.

> **Formal condition:**  
> $Dissonance(Fₙ) ⇔ ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)) \to \text{unstable}$  
> due to unresolvable or phase-incoherent ∆-inputs.

## Structural Explanation

Dissonance arises when:

- Recursive embeddings **interfere destructively**
- **Resonant alignment fails** across nested structures
- Stabilization tension **exceeds collapse threshold**

This leads to:

- Phase breakdown  
- Ontological incoherence  
- Drift into chaotic or collapsed states

## Formal Schema

Let:

- $F₁ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆ₐ))$  
- $F₂ = ⊚(Rᵐ(∆ᵦ))$

If:

- $Rⁿ(∆ₐ) \cap Rᵐ(∆ᵦ) ≠ ∅$  
- and $Resonance(F₁, F₂) = \text{false}$

Then:

- $Dissonance(F₁, F₂)$ holds  
- and $⊚(F₁ ∪ F₂) \to ∅$
