# PhaseCoherence

## Explanation / Definition

**PhaseCoherence** refers to the **temporal alignment of difference propagation** across a shared or coupled relational field. When multiple ∆‑waves remain **in stable synchrony over time**, they enable:

- sustained ∆‑Resonance  
- constructive interference  
- preservation of relational identity  

In ∆‑theory, PhaseCoherence is foundational to:

- memory formation  
- particle identity  
- recursive structure longevity  
- emergence of resonant ∆‑Fields  

> Formalization:  
> PhaseCoherence$(∆₁, ∆₂) ⇔ phase(∆₁(t)) ≈ phase(∆₂(t)) ∧ ⊚(R(∆₁ + ∆₂))$

---

## Formal Conditions

Let $∆₁(t)$ and $∆₂(t)$ be time-evolving difference oscillations embedded in a shared $R$‑context.

Then PhaseCoherence holds if:

- $phase(∆₁(t)) ≈ phase(∆₂(t))$ across a duration $T$  
- $R(∆₁ + ∆₂)$ remains structurally stabilized  
- Resulting system maintains coherent meta-form

## Core Properties

| Property            | ∆‑Theory Interpretation                                |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| Temporal Stability  | Prevents decoherence and collapse of difference forms  |
| Resonance Enabler   | Prerequisite for ∆‑Resonance and information exchange  |
| Memory Substrate    | Enables recursive retention and replay of ∆‑paths      |
| Interference Filter | Supports constructive, filters destructive ∆‑waves     |

## Usage

- Models **persistent particle identity** (e.g. electrons as recursive loops)  
- Explains **focused cognition**, internal coherence, and ∆‑lock in attention  
- Basis for **signal propagation**, **laser phase alignment**, and **quantum memory**  
- Describes **sociocultural resonance** (e.g. rituals, group coherence, entrainment)

## Dependencies

- [[Resonance]] — requires and sustains coherence  
- [[RelationalEmbedding]] — necessary for shared context  
- [[CollapseThreshold]] — coherence delays or prevents form breakdown  
- [[DeltaField (Ontological Substrate)]] — medium of wave propagation  
- [[RecursiveFormIdentity]] — stabilized form through temporal resonance  
- [[Interference]] — coherence regulates interference outcomes

| Domain             | Interpretation                                           |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| Laser light        | Perfect ∆‑phase alignment → coherent energy propagation |
| Human attention    | Internal synchrony → cognitive clarity and flow state   |
| Quantum memory     | Coherence of spin states → long-lived entanglement      |
| Social rhythm      | Group phase lock → cultural synchrony, collective flow  |
