# PathPersistence(Rⁿ)

---

## Explanation / Definition

**PathPersistence(Rⁿ)** quantifies the **temporal and structural durability** of a recursive relational chain $Rⁿ(∆₀)$.  
It captures the ability of that chain to **remain stable**, **retain identity**, and **resist collapse** across time, phase shifts, and environmental ∆‑flux.

> A form $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ is only meaningful **insofar as** its internal path $Rⁿ$ persists.

---

## Formal Expression

Let $Rⁿ(∆₀)$ denote the recursive embedding of a primitive difference.  
Then:

> $PathPersistence(Rⁿ) ∝ duration(⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀)))$

In words:  
PathPersistence is proportional to the **lifespan of the stabilized form** $Fₙ$ within a given ∆‑field.

## Determinants

| Factor                  | Influence                                                   |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Recursive Depth ($n$)   | Deeper paths are harder to maintain, but more resilient     |
| Internal Closure        | Completion of loop reinforces persistence                   |
| ∆‑Field Environment     | High ∆‑noise destabilizes relational integrity              |
| Phase Resonance         | Locking in recursive cycles sustains form                   |
| Structural Inertia      | Slows degradation across recursion                          |

## Core Properties

- **Structural Durability**: Capacity to resist deformation  
- **Temporal Stability**: Duration over which $⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ holds  
- **Collapse Risk Inverse**: High persistence → low collapse probability  
- **Mass / Identity Anchor**: Persistence defines form’s presence

---

## Usage

- Diagnosing **form longevity** (mass, memory, meaning)  
- Explaining **decay and ∆‑entropy** in complex systems  
- Modeling **resilient self-structures** or **cultural loops**  
- Understanding **why** some identities fade and others endure

## Examples / Case Studies

| System             | PathPersistence(Rⁿ) Insight                                 |
|--------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| Electron           | Shallow $n$, but high closure and stability → long-lived    |
| Neutron            | Shallow and weakly closed → decays within minutes           |
| DNA Transcription  | Recursive patterns with high fidelity → multigenerational   |
| Thought Pattern    | High if recursively reinforced (e.g. trauma loops)          |
| Social Movement    | Persists if rooted in deep, phase-locked recursion          |
