# StableForms

## Definition

A form $Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))$ is called **stable** if **every recursive layer of difference** from the base primitive ∆₀ up to level $n$ is **stabilized**:

> **Formal condition:**  
> $Fₙ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ∀ k ∈ [0, n]: ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))$

This means the form is **ontologically grounded across its full recursive depth** — with no internal instability or unsustained layer.

---

## Explanation

StableForms are:

- **Fully recursive and self-coherent**
- **Internally tension-balanced** at all levels
- Capable of **resonant persistence** and meaningful transmission
- Considered the **gold standard** for generative, identity-bearing forms in ∆‑theory

---

## Usage

- Used as **validation criteria** in recursive system modeling
- Basis for determining **integrity of memory**, **trust**, **identity**, and **form emergence**
- Benchmark for **differentiating form states**: stable vs apparent vs collapsed

## Summary

StableForms are the **ontological backbone** of coherent systems.  
They are **fully recursive**, **phase-locked**, and **internally resolved** — the only forms that can **persist, evolve, and generate difference**.
