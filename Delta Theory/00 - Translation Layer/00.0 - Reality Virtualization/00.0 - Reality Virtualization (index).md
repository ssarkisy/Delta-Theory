# 00.0 - Reality Virtualization (meta)

> Virtualize the ontological core into clear, operable abstractions before formal APIs.
> Bridge technical and humane registers to maintain both precision and humanity.

Onboarding: Read [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md) and [ROADMAP.md](../../../../ROADMAP.md). Dual‑register mapping (technical ↔ humane) is required in this layer.

---

## Scope

Express core primitives and modulators through dual-register mapping:
1. Technical systems (network/computational)
2. Lived experience (biological/relational)
3. Explicit bridges between registers

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the virtualization layer into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Layer concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|--------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Primitives | Core operations | `Delta`, `Embed`, `Close` |
| Environment | Boundaries | `Port`, `Gate`, `Surface` |
| Coherence | Synchronization | `Phase`, `Memory`, `Select` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Layer concept | Humane construct | Example |
|--------------|------------------|----------|
| Primitives | Basic experience | Notice, Connect, Hold |
| Environment | Living boundary | Meet, Share, Protect |
| Coherence | Living rhythm | Dance, Remember, Choose |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Operation | Experience | How difference moves |
| Interface | Boundary | Where systems meet |
| State | Memory | What persists |

## Module Structure

Three core modules with their anchoring modulators:

1. **Virtual Substrate (00.0.0)**
   - Primitives: ∆, R(·), ⊚, Form
   - Anchor: ∇S (Structure)
   - Role: Core operations

2. **Execution Environment (00.0.1)**
   - Focus: Ports, boundaries, thresholds
   - Anchor: λV (Void)
   - Role: Interface control

3. **Coherence Orchestration (00.0.2)**
   - Focus: Phase, identity, memory
   - Anchor: ψA (Awareness)
   - Role: Stability maintenance

---

## Core Operations

The virtualization layer provides three key capabilities:

1. **Primitive Operations**
   - Technical: Core transforms and closures
   - Humane: Basic patterns of experience

2. **Boundary Management**
   - Technical: Interface control and protection
   - Humane: Safe sharing and connection

3. **Coherence Control**
   - Technical: State and synchronization
   - Humane: Memory and rhythm

---

## Stability Principles

1. **Dual-register stability**
   - Every technical mapping needs a humane counterpart
   - Explicit bridges between registers
   - Neither register reducible to the other

2. **Kernel-first development**
   - Stabilize primitives before building up
   - Minimal but complete ABI
   - Clear operational semantics

3. **Vocabulary-first bridging**
   - Use virtualization terms consistently
   - Bridge into APIs later
   - Maintain term stability

4. **Progressive stabilization**
   - Track status: seed → unstable → stable
   - Test both registers
   - Verify bridges

---

## Design Rationale

This virtualization layer is deliberately **bi-polar**:

- The **technical register** ensures the ontology can bind to computational, network, and formal systems.
- The **biological register** ensures the ontology remains connected to lived, embodied, and emotional experience.

These poles **must** coexist for stability. Humans are not reducible to graphs, and technical systems cannot be meaningfully reduced to biological metaphors. The bridge exists to preserve **structural fidelity** while avoiding dehumanization or over-naturalization of technology. Removing either pole would collapse the model's scope and distort its ethical grounding.

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Primitive Layer**
   - Define core operations
   - Test both registers
   - Establish bridges

2. **Environment Layer**
   - Build on primitives
   - Define interfaces
   - Control boundaries

3. **Coherence Layer**
   - Ensure stability
   - Manage memory
   - Maintain identity
