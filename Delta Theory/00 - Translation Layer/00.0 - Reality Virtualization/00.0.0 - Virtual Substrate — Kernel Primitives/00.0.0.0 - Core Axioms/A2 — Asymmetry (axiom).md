# A2 — Asymmetry (axiom)

> For primitive difference, ∆(A, B) ≠ ∆(B, A) in general.

---

## Statement

- Direction/order matters for ∆; reversing relata yields a distinct difference relation unless stabilized by symmetry conditions.

---

## Rationale (context)

- Encodes orientation in propagation; prevents trivial cancellation of differences.

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: A1
- Applies to: [[Delta]]; all relational embeddings [[RelationalEmbedding]]

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Bias toward asymmetric stabilization (links to [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)]])
- Distinguishes propagation vs absorption channels in forms

---
