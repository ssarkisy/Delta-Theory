# A3 — Recursivity (axiom)

> Forms arise via recursive embedding and closure of differences.

---

## Statement

- Stable forms emerge only through recursive application of difference embedding, leading to closure.

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the axiom into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Recursivity | Nested structure | `RecursiveWrapper` |
| Growth | Transformation chain | `GrowthSequence` |
| Closure | Stable pattern | `PatternMatcher` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Recursivity | Pattern recognition | When meaning deepens with each look |
| Growth | Natural unfolding | Watching a flower bloom over time |
| Closure | "Getting it" | When scattered pieces click into place |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Nested structure | Layered meaning | Depth through self-reference |
| Transform chain | Natural rhythm | How change builds on itself |
| Stable pattern | Living form | When difference finds its shape |

## Domain Mapping

Brief consequences across domains, showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Wave functions | Resonant patterns |
| Chemistry | Molecular assembly | Emergent properties |
| Biology | Growth patterns | Organic development |
| Social | Network clusters | Community formation |
| Economy | Compound growth | Value creation |
| Politics | Institution building | Cultural evolution |
| Networks | Recursive graphs | Nested communities |
| Cognition | Pattern recognition | Meaning making |

## Register note (if governance)

- This is a kernel axiom (not governance). For governance principles, see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md).

---

## Rationale (context)

- Establishes mechanism for form emergence
- Enables stable structure formation
- Creates basis for growth and transformation patterns

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: other axioms
- Applies to: all form-making processes and closure operations

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Growth: natural transformation rate emerges (e)
- Closure: circular/wave geometry emerges (π)
- Depth: recursive embedding creates hierarchies
- Form: enables stable pattern recognition (F)
