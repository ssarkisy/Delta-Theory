# A3 — Recursivity (axiom)

> Primitive difference participates in recursive embeddings; structure arises via repeated application of relational embedding.

---

## Statement

- There exists a relational operator R such that forms emerge as $F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0))$ for some $n \ge 0$ under stabilization conditions.

---

## Rationale (context)

- Captures the generative mechanism of structure from ∆; aligns with RDRF/RDPF notes.

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: A1, A2
- Applies to: recursive embeddings, stabilization/closure operations

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Generativity of forms; layered complexity
- Need for stabilization/modulators (∇S, λV, ψA) and anchors (ε, π, e, φ, c)
