# A1 — Irreducibility (axiom)

> Primitive difference (∆) cannot be decomposed without loss of distinction.

---

## Statement

- ∆ is ontologically primitive: any attempt to express ∆ as a composition of prior differences eliminates the very distinction it asserts.

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the axiom into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Irreducibility | Atomic event | `PrimitiveEvent` |
| Resolution | Quantum threshold | `MinimalDifference` |
| Distinction | Binary state | `DistinctState` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Irreducibility | Raw sensation | The first moment of tasting something new |
| Resolution | Just-noticeable difference | When a change becomes felt |
| Distinction | Pure awareness | The "aha!" before any analysis |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Atomic event | Raw sensation | Irreducible unit of experience |
| Quantum threshold | Felt threshold | Minimal meaningful difference |
| Binary state | Pure awareness | Distinction before description |

## Domain Mapping

Brief consequences across domains, showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Quantum measurement | Observer effect |
| Chemistry | Atomic states | Bonding affinities |
| Biology | Genetic base pairs | Phenotype expression |
| Social | Individual nodes | Personal identity |
| Economy | Unit of account | Perceived value |
| Politics | Voting unit | Citizen agency |
| Networks | Graph vertex | Agent autonomy |
| Cognition | Neural spike | Qualia |

## Register note (if governance)

- This is a kernel axiom (not governance). For governance principles, see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md).

---

## Rationale (context)

- Anchors the base of the recursive stack
- Prevents infinite regress before ∆
- Ensures stable foundation for difference-based recursion

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: other axioms
- Applies to: [[Delta]]; all embeddings of ∆ via [[RelationalEmbedding]]

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Generativity: stable structures must ultimately originate in irreducible ∆
- NonNumerical: quantitative measures arise only after embedding/closure
- Resolution: minimum meaningful difference quantum (ε)

---

## Related structures

- Primitives: [[Delta]] · [[RelationalEmbedding]] · [[Stabilization (Closure)]] · [[Form]]
- Constants: [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]]
- Modulators: ∇S (structure differentiation) depends on irreducible base
