# A1 — Irreducibility (axiom)

> Primitive difference (∆) cannot be decomposed without loss of distinction.

---

## Statement

- ∆ is ontologically primitive: any attempt to express ∆ as a composition of prior differences eliminates the very distinction it asserts.

---

## Rationale (context)

- Anchors the base of the recursive stack; prevents infinite regress before ∆.

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: other axioms
- Applies to: [[Delta]]; all embeddings of ∆ via [[RelationalEmbedding]]

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Generativity: stable structures must ultimately originate in irreducible ∆
- NonNumerical: quantitative measures arise only after embedding/closure
