# 00.0.0.0 - Core Axioms (meta)

> Foundational statements that ground the kernel. These axioms constrain primitives and interfaces.

---

## Scope

- Core ontological axioms (A1-A3) that define the irreducible base
- SVA triad mapping and constant emergence
- Axiom dependencies and implications
- Axiom-to-primitive mappings

---

## SVA Triad Mapping

| Axiom | Polarity | Domain | Core Role |
|-------|----------|---------|-----------|
| A1 (Irreducibility) | P0 | Awareness | Distinction itself |
| A2 (Asymmetry) | P- | Void | Field directionality |
| A3 (Recursivity) | P+ | Structure | Form-making |

---

## Anchors & Emergence

Primary constants (direct):
- A1 → ε (resolution quantum)
- A2 → φ (stabilization ratio)
- A3 → e (transformation rate)

Emergent constants (derived):
- A2 → c (propagation limit)
- A3 → π (closure geometry)

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the axioms into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Module concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Irreducibility | Atomic event              | `PrimitiveEvent`    |
| Asymmetry      | Directed edge             | `DirectedLink`      |
| Recursivity    | Nested closure            | `RecursiveWrapper`  |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Module concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Irreducibility | Basic sensation           | Raw perception before analysis |
| Asymmetry      | Role/context dependence   | Parent-child vs child-parent |
| Recursivity    | Pattern recognition       | "I see what you mean" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning                    |
|----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------|
| Atomic event   | Raw sensation | Irreducible unit of difference       |
| Directed link  | Role context  | Asymmetric embedding of difference   |
| Nested closure | Recognition   | Recursive stabilization of patterns  |

## Design rationale

These axioms establish the minimal foundation needed for difference-based recursion. See [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md) for how they avoid reduction (biology ≠ networks; tech ≠ biology).

## Domain Mapping (optional)

Brief manifestations across domains, showing SVA triad alignment:

| Domain | Structure (A3) | Void (A2) | Awareness (A1) |
|--------|---------------|------------|----------------|
| Physics | Wave patterns | Field propagation | Quantum measurement |
| Chemistry | Molecular structure | Reaction paths | Bonding states |
| Biology | Growth forms | Environmental flow | Sensory distinction |
| Social | Community patterns | Influence paths | Identity recognition |
| Economy | Market structure | Value flows | Price discovery |
| Politics | Institutions | Power dynamics | Cultural awareness |
| Networks | Graph topology | Message routing | State coherence |
| Cognition | Memory patterns | Attention flow | Conscious distinction |
