# 00.0.0.0 - Core Axioms (meta)

> Foundational statements that ground the kernel. This index is unstable and will change as subfolders/axioms are added.

---

## Purpose

Collect and index axioms (e.g., “Difference precedes Form”) that constrain primitives and interfaces.

---

## Contents (to be expanded)

- [[A1 — Irreducibility (axiom)]] — ∆ cannot be decomposed without loss
- [[A2 — Asymmetry (axiom)]] — order matters: ∆(A,B) ≠ ∆(B,A)
- [[A3 — Recursivity (axiom)]] — forms arise via recursive embedding and closure
