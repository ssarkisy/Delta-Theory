# 00.0.0.2 - Structural Primitives (meta)

> Core structural concepts (∆, R(·), ⊚, F). This index is unstable and will change as subfolders/notes are added.

---

## Purpose

Collect the kernel primitives and their immediate derivatives for quick access and evolution.

---

## Contents (to be expanded)

- [[Delta]] — Primitive Difference (stable)
- [[RelationalEmbedding]] — Relational Embedding (seed)
- [[Stabilization (Closure)]] — Stabilization / Closure (seed)
- [[Form]] — Interface result of ⊚(R(·)) (seed)

---

## Clarification — ontology vs observables

- Primitives here are the kernel operations: **∆**, **R(·)**, **⊚**
- **Form (F)** is included as the interface/result of stabilization: observable Structure
- **Structure** itself is an ontological axis (see [[Structure]]), not a primitive
- **Field** is observable **Void** (interfaces open); diagnostics live under `20.0.2 - Field Classifications`
- Diagnostics for observable Structure live under `20.0.1 - Form Classifications`
