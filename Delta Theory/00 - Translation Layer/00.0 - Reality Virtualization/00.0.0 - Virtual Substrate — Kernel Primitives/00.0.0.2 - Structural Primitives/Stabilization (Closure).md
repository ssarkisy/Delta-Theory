# Stabilization (Closure) — ⊚

> **⊚** evaluates embedded difference for **recursive coherence**, producing **closure** that sustains a Form.

---

## Definition

Stabilization is the **closure operation** that locks feedback loops and boundary conditions so that embedded difference persists as structure.

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the primitive into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Closure | Control loop | `SessionCloser` |
| Feedback | State lock | `StateLock` |
| Coherence | Consensus | `QuorumGate` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Closure | Habit formation | "It sticks now" |
| Feedback | Self-reinforcing | "Gets stronger" |
| Coherence | Group rhythm | "Moving as one" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Control loop | Habit | What keeps form stable |
| State lock | Memory | What holds shape |
| Consensus | Unity | How parts align |

---

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Phase lock | Natural stability |
| Chemistry | Bond formation | Chemical unity |
| Biology | Homeostasis | Life balance |
| Social | Agreement | Trust bond |
| Economy | Settlement | Value lock |
| Politics | Enactment | Power hold |
| Networks | Commitment | System state |
| Cognition | Memory lock | Understanding |

## Formal identity

$$
F := ⊚(R(∆)) \quad ; \quad F_n := ⊚(R^n(∆_0))
$$

- Closure succeeds when coherence thresholds are met
- Failure yields dissipation or collapse

---

## Role in the loop

- Enacts Structure by turning embedded difference into persistent Form
- Negotiates Void perturbations via thresholds and boundary conditions
- Enables Awareness to maintain identity across cycles

Note: ⊚ stabilizes Structure → Form. Void → Field is not a stabilization; it is interface transparency (λV) and capacity making an exterior observable.

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Thresholds — minimal coherence measures (e.g., phase, tension, closure strength)
- Retention — feedback must reinforce rather than dissipate
- Interface discipline — boundary contracts must be respected

---

## Design rationale

Dual‑register mapping is required (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)) to prevent reducing closure to either technical loops or humane habits; ⊚ must be legible in both.
