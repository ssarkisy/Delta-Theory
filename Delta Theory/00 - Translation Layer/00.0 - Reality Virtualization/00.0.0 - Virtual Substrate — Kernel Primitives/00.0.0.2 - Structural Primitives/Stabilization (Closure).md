# Stabilization (Closure) — ⊚

> **⊚** evaluates embedded difference for **recursive coherence**, producing **closure** that sustains a Form.

---

## Definition

Stabilization is the **closure operation** that locks feedback loops and boundary conditions so that embedded difference persists as structure.

---

## Formal identity

$$
F := ⊚(R(∆)) \quad ; \quad F_n := ⊚(R^n(∆_0))
$$

- Closure succeeds when coherence thresholds are met
- Failure yields dissipation or collapse

---

## Role in the loop

- Enacts Structure by turning embedded difference into persistent Form
- Negotiates Void perturbations via thresholds and boundary conditions
- Enables Awareness to maintain identity across cycles

Note: ⊚ stabilizes Structure → Form. Void → Field is not a stabilization; it is interface transparency (λV) and capacity making an exterior observable.

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Thresholds — minimal coherence measures (e.g., phase, tension, closure strength)
- Retention — feedback must reinforce rather than dissipate
- Interface discipline — boundary contracts must be respected

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: phase transition nucleates; bound state forms
- Chemistry: bond formation; reaction reaches completion criterion
- Biology: synaptic consolidation; homeostatic setpoint attainment
- Social: both people say “yes” to meet (time/place agreed)
- Economy: payment confirmed; settlement final
- Politics: bill passes all gates; policy becomes enforceable
- Networks: consensus reached; transaction committed
- Cognition: you rehearsed/slept; memory “sticks”
