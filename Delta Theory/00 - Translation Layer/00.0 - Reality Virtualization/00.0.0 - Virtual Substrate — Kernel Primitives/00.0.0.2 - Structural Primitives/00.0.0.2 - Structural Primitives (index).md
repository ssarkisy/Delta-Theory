# 00.0.0.2 - Structural Primitives (index)

> Core operational primitives that form the kernel: ∆ (difference), R(·) (embedding), ⊚ (closure), and F (form).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the four fundamental primitives that enable difference-based recursion:

- **Delta (∆):** The irreducible unit of difference
- **Relational Embedding R(·):** The context-binding operation
- **Stabilization (⊚):** The recursive closure operation
- **Form (F):** The emergent stable structure

These primitives work together in a canonical sequence (∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F) to transform raw difference into stable, observable forms. Each primitive is defined with both technical precision and humane understanding.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Core Primitives | Foundational operations | [[Delta]], [[RelationalEmbedding]], [[Stabilization (Closure)]], [[Form]] |
| Canonical Flow | Operation sequence | ∆ (detect) → R(·) (embed) → ⊚ (close) → F (stabilize) |
| Axiom Mapping | Grounding principles | A1 → ∆, A2 → R(·), A3 → ⊚, All → F |
| Modulator Effects | Control parameters | ∇S (depth), λV (threshold), ψA (phase) |

Each primitive provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Operational semantics
- Stability conditions
- Implementation guidelines

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Core Flow**
   - Start with ∆ detection
   - Build R(·) context
   - Establish ⊚ loops
   - Stabilize F states

2. **Stability Requirements**
   - Clear event boundaries
   - Consistent context
   - Reliable closure
   - Persistent form

3. **Interface Design**
   - Event API
   - Context API
   - Loop API
   - State API

4. **Error Handling**
   - Detection failures
   - Context loss
   - Loop breaks
   - State corruption
