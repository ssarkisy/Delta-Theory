# Relational Embedding — R(·)

> **R(·)** situates a difference **within relations**, providing the context that shapes potential stabilization.

---

## Definition

Relational Embedding maps ∆ into a **network of distinctions**, exposing paths, tensions, and boundary conditions necessary for closure.

---

## Formal identity

$$
R^n(∆_0) \quad \text{feeds} \quad ⊚(\cdot) \Rightarrow F_n
$$

- Depth `n` reflects recursive embedding layers
- Embedding sets the conditions that `⊚` evaluates for stabilization

---

## Role in the loop

- Positions Structure within a broader Void-facing graph
- Determines available interfaces, thresholds, and potential closures
- Conditions Awareness by shaping identifiable patterns

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Consistency — relations must be coherent enough to evaluate closure
- Transparency — interfaces expose sufficient context for stabilization
- Depth/Cost — embedding depth trades off with closure likelihood

## Cross-domain examples

- Human interactions / society: mutual friends/shared group give context
- Money / economy: which exchange/broker/payment rail you use
- Cognition: where the sound fits (place/time); related memories
