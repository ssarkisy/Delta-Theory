# Delta (Primitive Difference)

> **∆** is the **irreducible act of distinction** — the onset of non‑identity that seeds all structure.

---

## Definition

∆ is not a magnitude or object. It is the **minimal difference event** from which relational embedding and stabilization proceed.

---

## Formal identity

$$
∆ \to R(∆) \to ⊚(R(∆)) = F
$$

- `R(·)` — relational embedding
- `⊚` — stabilization / closure
- `F` — resulting Form

---

## Role in the loop

- Acts at the origin of Structure as primitive contrast
- Seeds embedding into Void via interfaces
- Enables Awareness to select and retain coherent identity over time

---

## Axioms & Derived invariants

- [[A1 — Irreducibility (axiom)]] — ∆ cannot be decomposed without loss of distinction
- [[A2 — Asymmetry (axiom)]] — ∆(A, B) ≠ ∆(B, A) in general
- [[A3 — Recursivity (axiom)]] — ∆ participates in recursive embeddings enabling layered complexity
- Derived: Generativity — stable structures ultimately originate in stabilizable ∆ (from A1 + A3)
- Definition-level: NonNumerical — ∆ encodes qualitative contrast; quantities arise via embedding/measurement
