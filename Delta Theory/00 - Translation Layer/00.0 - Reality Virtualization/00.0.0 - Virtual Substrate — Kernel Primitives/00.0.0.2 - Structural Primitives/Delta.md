# Delta (Primitive Difference)

> **∆** is the **irreducible act of distinction** — the onset of non‑identity that seeds all structure.

---

## Definition

∆ is not a magnitude or object. It is the **minimal difference event** from which relational embedding and stabilization proceed.

---

## Formal identity

$$
∆ \to R(∆) \to ⊚(R(∆)) = F
$$

- `R(·)` — relational embedding
- `⊚` — stabilization / closure
- `F` — resulting Form

---

## Role in the loop

- Acts at the origin of Structure as primitive contrast
- Seeds embedding into Void via interfaces
- Enables Awareness to select and retain coherent identity over time

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Irreducibility — cannot be decomposed without loss of distinction
- Generativity — every structure ultimately originates in stabilizable ∆
- Asymmetry — ∆(A, B) ≠ ∆(B, A)
- NonNumerical — encodes qualitative contrast, not merely quantity
- Recursivity — participates in recursive embeddings enabling layered complexity

- Money / economy: noticing a cheaper price elsewhere
- Cognition: a surprising sound grabs attention
