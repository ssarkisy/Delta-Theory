# Form (F)

> Interface for module: stabilized configuration of embedded difference (output of $⊚(R(·))$) — a coherent unit capable of persistence and interaction.

---

## Definition

A Form is a stabilized configuration of embedded difference that can persist and interact. It emerges when closure succeeds and maintains coherence under perturbation.

### Special Cases

Forms can manifest in different ways, with [[Polarity]] being a unique special case:

1. **General Forms**
   - Stabilize difference into persistent patterns
   - May reduce difference's dynamic nature
   - Focus on structural stability

2. **Polarity (P±)**
   - Preserves difference's generative nature
   - Maintains dynamic opposition
   - Enables recursive embedding while preserving difference characteristics
   - Represents the minimal stable configuration that maintains difference's power

This distinction shows how Form can either:
- Stabilize difference into static patterns (general case)
- Preserve difference's dynamic nature through structured opposition (polarity case)

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the interface into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Form concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|-------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Identity | Stable session | `Session`, `IdentityTracker` |
| State | Committed data | `StateManager`, `Snapshot` |
| Boundary | Interface contract | `Boundary`, `Protocol` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Form concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|-------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Identity | Recognized pattern | "I know this shape" |
| State | Living memory | "This is how it is" |
| Boundary | Clear edges | "Where it starts/ends" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Session | Recognition | Stable identity over time |
| State | Memory | What persists |
| Contract | Edge | Where form meets world |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | General Form | Polarity Form | Humane manifestation |
|--------|--------------|---------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Bound state | Electron/proton pair | Natural shape/dynamic balance |
| Chemistry | Stable molecule | Acid/base pair | Distinct substance/reactive pair |
| Biology | Cell identity | Nucleus/membrane dynamic | Living form/adaptive system |
| Social | Partnership record | Innovation/tradition cycle | Lasting bond/evolving relationship |
| Economy | Account position | Market supply/demand | Owned value/dynamic exchange |
| Politics | Institution | Power/resistance dynamic | Living tradition/adaptive system |
| Networks | Durable session | Active/passive nodes | Known identity/dynamic role |
| Cognition | Memory trace | Focus/context relationship | Clear concept/dynamic understanding |

## Formal identity

### General Form
$$
F := ⊚(R(∆)) \quad ; \quad F_n := ⊚(R^n(∆_0))
$$

### Polarity as Special Case
$$
P± := ⊚(R(∆)) \quad \text{where} \quad R(∆) \text{ preserves } \Delta \text{'s dynamic nature}
$$

The key distinction is in how R(∆) operates:
- For general forms, R(∆) may stabilize difference into static patterns
- For polarity, R(∆) must preserve difference's generative and asymmetric nature

## Role in the loop

- Materializes Structure from embedded difference
- Projects into Void via interfaces; receives perturbation/feedback
- Is maintained by Awareness through phase coherence and memory

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Closure integrity (loop strength, boundary conditions)
- Coherence (phase alignment, identity retention)
- Persistence under perturbation (resilience)

---

## Design rationale

Dual‑register mapping is required (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)) to avoid reducing Form to either a technical session/state or a humane recognition alone; it must be legible in both.
