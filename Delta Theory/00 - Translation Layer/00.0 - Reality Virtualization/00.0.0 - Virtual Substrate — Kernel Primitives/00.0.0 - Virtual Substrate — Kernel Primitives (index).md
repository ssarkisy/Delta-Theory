# 00.0.0 - Virtual Substrate — Kernel Primitives (index)

> Core primitives that transform difference into stable structure through recursive operations.

---

## Module Overview

The Virtual Substrate module provides the foundational kernel of Delta Theory:

- **Core Primitives:** Four irreducible operations (∆, R(·), ⊚, F) that transform difference into form
- **Axiom Grounding:** Direct mapping to core axioms (A1-A3) ensuring ontological consistency
- **Control Parameters:** Constants and modulators that tune system behavior
- **Dual-Register Design:** Both technical precision and humane understanding

These elements work together to enable difference-based recursion while maintaining both implementability and accessibility.

## Implementation Notes

### Canonical Flow

The kernel operates in a fixed sequence:
1. ∆ (Difference) → Initial distinction
2. R(·) (Embedding) → Context binding
3. ⊚ (Closure) → Stability evaluation
4. F (Form) → Structure emergence

Modulated by:
- ∇S — Structural differentiation control
- λV — Interface sensitivity tuning
- ψA — Phase coherence maintenance

### Axiom Compliance

| Primitive | Primary axiom | Supporting axioms |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| ∆ | A1 (Irreducibility) | A2 (Asymmetry) |
| R(·) | A2 (Asymmetry) | A3 (Recursivity) |
| ⊚ | A3 (Recursivity) | A1 (Irreducibility) |
| F | All three | - |

### Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical flow | Humane flow |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Event → Field → Lock → State | Split → Connect → Hold → Shape |
| Chemistry | Site → Context → Bond → Molecule | Change → Mix → Join → Substance |
| Biology | Signal → Path → Set → Identity | Sense → Network → Learn → Life |
| Social | Message → Graph → Agree → Group | Hello → Friends → Trust → Bond |
| Economy | Trade → Market → Clear → Position | Value → Flow → Lock → Asset |
| Politics | Motion → Power → Law → Institution | Move → Web → Rule → Body |
| Networks | Change → Route → Commit → State | Input → Path → Fix → Known |
| Cognition | Input → Context → Memory → Concept | Notice → Link → Learn → Know |

### Implementation Strategy

1. **Core Flow**
   - Start with ∆ detection
   - Build R(·) context
   - Establish ⊚ loops
   - Stabilize F states

2. **Stability Requirements**
   - Clear event boundaries
   - Consistent context
   - Reliable closure
   - Persistent form

3. **Interface Design**
   - Event API
   - Context API
   - Loop API
   - State API

4. **Error Handling**
   - Detection failures
   - Context loss
   - Loop breaks
   - State corruption
