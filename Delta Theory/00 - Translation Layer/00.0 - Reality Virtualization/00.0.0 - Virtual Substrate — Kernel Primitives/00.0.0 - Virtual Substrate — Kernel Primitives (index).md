# 00.0.0 - Virtual Substrate — Kernel Primitives (meta)

> Core primitives that form the kernel: ∆ (difference), R(·) (embedding), ⊚ (closure), and F (form).
> These primitives work together to enable difference to become stable structure.

---

## Scope

The kernel primitives provide the foundational operations for transforming difference into form:

1. ∆ (Primitive Difference) — irreducible distinction
2. R(·) (Relational Embedding) — contextual situation
3. ⊚ (Stabilization/Closure) — coherence lock
4. F (Form) — stable outcome

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the kernel into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive | Network construct | Interface example |
|-----------|------------------|-------------------|
| ∆ | Event detection | `ChangeDetector` |
| R(·) | Graph topology | `ContextGraph` |
| ⊚ | Control loop | `SessionCloser` |
| F | Stable session | `IdentityTracker` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive | Humane construct | Example |
|-----------|-----------------|---------|
| ∆ | First noticing | "Something's different" |
| R(·) | Web of relations | "How things connect" |
| ⊚ | Habit formation | "It sticks now" |
| F | Living pattern | "This is the shape" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Event | Noticing | First distinction |
| Topology | Web | How difference sits |
| Loop | Habit | What keeps stable |
| Session | Pattern | Persistent form |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical flow | Humane flow |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Event → Field → Lock → State | Split → Connect → Hold → Shape |
| Chemistry | Site → Context → Bond → Molecule | Change → Mix → Join → Substance |
| Biology | Signal → Path → Set → Identity | Sense → Network → Learn → Life |
| Social | Message → Graph → Agree → Group | Hello → Friends → Trust → Bond |
| Economy | Trade → Market → Clear → Position | Value → Flow → Lock → Asset |
| Politics | Motion → Power → Law → Institution | Move → Web → Rule → Body |
| Networks | Change → Route → Commit → State | Input → Path → Fix → Known |
| Cognition | Input → Context → Memory → Concept | Notice → Link → Learn → Know |

## Kernel Flow

The primitives form a canonical sequence:

1. ∆ (Difference) provides the initial distinction
2. R(·) (Embedding) situates it in context
3. ⊚ (Closure) evaluates for stability
4. F (Form) emerges if closure succeeds

This flow is modulated by:
- ∇S — controls structural differentiation
- λV — sets interface sensitivity
- ψA — maintains phase coherence

---

## Axiom Mapping

Each primitive expresses core axioms:

| Primitive | Primary axiom | Supporting axioms |
|-----------|--------------|-------------------|
| ∆ | A1 (Irreducibility) | A2 (Asymmetry) |
| R(·) | A2 (Asymmetry) | A3 (Recursivity) |
| ⊚ | A3 (Recursivity) | A1 (Irreducibility) |
| F | All three | - |

---

## Design rationale

The kernel primitives must be intelligible in both technical and humane registers per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Each primitive maintains its dual nature without reduction to either register.
