# λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)

> Void‑facing modulator that sets the **receptivity/ignition threshold** at interfaces.
> Decides whether incoming difference is **amplified**, **passed through**, or **damped/collapses**.

---

## Definition

λV governs the **sensitivity and stability** of boundaries. It tunes when a difference crossing an interface
will spark propagation vs be absorbed. In practice, λV shapes backpressure, saturation, and ignition/collapse edges.

---

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Gate semantics: for input signal $x$, propagation requires $x \geq λV$ under available $ψA$ and $∇S$ support

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- ε — minimal signal to engage the field
- φ — imbalance tolerance for ignition vs damping
- c — propagation ceiling for resonance through the field

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Void
- Modulates: receptivity, interface stability, ignition/collapse
- Enables: safe exposure of structure to outside differences

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Stability window: too low λV → noise floods; too high λV → starvation
- Hysteresis: separate on/off thresholds prevent thrashing
- Coupling: higher $ψA$ permits lower λV without collapse; higher $∇S$ may require higher λV
- Failure modes:
  - Under‑threshold: useful signals are dropped
  - Overload: uncontrolled resonance → collapse

## Network mapping

Three rows reflect S/V/A perspectives of the same modulator.

| Modulator (axis) | Network construct (Target)        | Interface/API example        |
|------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------|
| λV (Structure)   | Feature exposure threshold        | FeatureFlagThreshold, MinSignal |
| λV (Void)        | Interface sensitivity/backpressure| RateLimiter, CircuitBreaker  |
| λV (Awareness)   | Attention/salience gate           | AttentionGate, SNRThreshold  |

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: ignition thresholds; percolation onset
- Chemistry: activation energy; catalyst lowers λV equivalent
- Biology: sensory threshold; receptor activation curves
- Social: decide when to reply or engage; minimal effort to join a group
- Economy: minimum order size; collateral/margin requirements
- Politics: quorum rules; legislative thresholds
- Networks: rate limits; circuit breakers
- Cognition: stimulus must exceed notice threshold to enter awareness
