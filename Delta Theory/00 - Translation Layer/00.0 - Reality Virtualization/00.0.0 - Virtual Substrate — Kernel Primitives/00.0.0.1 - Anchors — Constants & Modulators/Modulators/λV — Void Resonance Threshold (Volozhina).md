# λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)

> Void‑facing modulator that sets the **receptivity/ignition threshold** at interfaces.
> Decides whether incoming difference is **amplified**, **passed through**, or **damped/collapses**.

---

## Definition

λV governs the **sensitivity and stability** of boundaries. It tunes when a difference crossing an interface
will spark propagation vs be absorbed. In practice, λV shapes backpressure, saturation, and ignition/collapse edges.

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the modulator into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Modulator concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Threshold | Feature exposure gate | `FeatureFlagThreshold` |
| Sensitivity | Interface backpressure | `RateLimiter`, `CircuitBreaker` |
| Attention | Signal-noise gate | `SNRThreshold`, `AttentionGate` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Modulator concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Threshold | Readiness boundary | "We're not ready for this yet" |
| Sensitivity | Receptivity state | "Not now" - healthy boundary |
| Attention | Noticing threshold | What matters enough to see |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Gate threshold | Readiness | When difference can enter |
| Backpressure | Boundary strength | How system protects itself |
| Signal gate | Care threshold | What gets attention |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Ignition threshold | Natural barrier |
| Chemistry | Activation energy | Catalytic readiness |
| Biology | Receptor threshold | Sensory awareness |
| Social | Group entry bar | Trust boundary |
| Economy | Minimum viable size | Value threshold |
| Politics | Quorum requirement | Movement momentum |
| Networks | Rate limit | System protection |
| Cognition | Attention filter | Conscious threshold |

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Gate semantics: for input signal $x$, propagation requires $x \geq λV$ under available $ψA$ and $∇S$ support

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- ε — minimal signal to engage the field
- φ — imbalance tolerance for ignition vs damping
- c — propagation ceiling for resonance through the field

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Void
- Modulates: receptivity, interface stability, ignition/collapse
- Enables: safe exposure of structure to outside differences

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Stability window: too low λV → noise floods; too high λV → starvation
- Hysteresis: separate on/off thresholds prevent thrashing
- Coupling: higher $ψA$ permits lower λV without collapse; higher $∇S$ may require higher λV
- Failure modes:
  - Under‑threshold: useful signals are dropped
  - Overload: uncontrolled resonance → collapse

---

## Cross‑register failure modes

- Technical: gate too low → noise flood; gate too high → starvation; missing hysteresis → thrash
- Humane: over‑openness → overwhelm; over‑closed → isolation; unclear readiness/consent → rupture

---

## Design rationale

Dual‑register mapping is required (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)) so λV governs both interface sensitivity and humane readiness/consent without collapse into one register.
