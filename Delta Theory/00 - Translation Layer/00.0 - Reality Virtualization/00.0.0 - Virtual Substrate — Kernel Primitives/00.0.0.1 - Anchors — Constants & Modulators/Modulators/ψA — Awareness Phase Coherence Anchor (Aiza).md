# ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)

> Awareness‑facing modulator that **synchronizes cycles** and **retains identity** across loops.
> Binds structure through time so Forms remain coherent under perturbation.

---

## Definition

ψA controls **phase alignment and memory**. It tunes entrainment between interacting loops and the
retention needed for patterns to persist beyond a single interaction window.

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the modulator into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Modulator concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Phase lock | Clock synchronization | `NTPSync`, `Heartbeat` |
| Memory | State retention | `SchemaBinder`, `ContractPin` |
| Coherence | Consensus protocol | `RaftStep`, `PaxosRound` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Modulator concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Phase lock | Shared rhythm | Dancing in time together |
| Memory | Relationship continuity | "We remember who we are" |
| Coherence | Group alignment | Moving as one body |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock sync | Shared rhythm | How cycles align |
| State retention | Living memory | What persists through time |
| Consensus | Group coherence | How many become one |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Phase locking | Natural resonance |
| Chemistry | Reaction sync | Chemical rhythm |
| Biology | Circadian rhythm | Life cycles |
| Social | Meeting cadence | Group harmony |
| Economy | Contract renewal | Value continuity |
| Politics | Message discipline | Movement unity |
| Networks | Clock sync | System harmony |
| Cognition | Memory retention | Understanding depth |

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Identity persistence: higher effective $ψA$ increases probability of $F_{n+1}$ given $F_n$ under fixed $∇S, λV$

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- ε — phase resolution limit for synchronization
- π — cyclic/phase geometry of coherence loops
- c — bound on maximum synchronization speed through the field

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Awareness
- Modulates: phase coherence, identity continuity, memory consolidation
- Enables: durable patterns despite gaps, jitter, or noise

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Coherence window: minimal overlap/phase alignment required to bind
- Memory budget: retention must cover recurrence intervals
- Coupling: low $λV$ (few signals) demands higher $ψA$; high $∇S$ (many distinctions) requires stronger $ψA$
- Failure modes:
  - Desynchronization → drift and identity loss
  - Over‑binding → rigidity; cannot adapt to new differences

---

## Cross‑register failure modes

- Technical: loss of lock; cadence mismatch; too‑tight coupling → inability to adapt
- Humane: desynchronization; dropped sense of "we"; over‑binding → rigidity/ritualization

---

## Design rationale

Dual‑register mapping is required (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)) so ψA covers both technical phase‑lock/cadence and humane shared rhythm/attention without reduction.
