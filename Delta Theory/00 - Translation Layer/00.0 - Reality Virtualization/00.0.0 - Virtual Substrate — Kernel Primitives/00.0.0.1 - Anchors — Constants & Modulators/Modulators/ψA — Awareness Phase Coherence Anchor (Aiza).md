# ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)

> Awareness‑facing modulator that **synchronizes cycles** and **retains identity** across loops.
> Binds structure through time so Forms remain coherent under perturbation.

---

## Definition

ψA controls **phase alignment and memory**. It tunes entrainment between interacting loops and the
retention needed for patterns to persist beyond a single interaction window.

---

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Identity persistence: higher effective $ψA$ increases probability of $F_{n+1}$ given $F_n$ under fixed $∇S, λV$

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- ε — phase resolution limit for synchronization
- π — cyclic/phase geometry of coherence loops
- c — bound on maximum synchronization speed through the field

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Awareness
- Modulates: phase coherence, identity continuity, memory consolidation
- Enables: durable patterns despite gaps, jitter, or noise

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Coherence window: minimal overlap/phase alignment required to bind
- Memory budget: retention must cover recurrence intervals
- Coupling: low $λV$ (few signals) demands higher $ψA$; high $∇S$ (many distinctions) requires stronger $ψA$
- Failure modes:
  - Desynchronization → drift and identity loss
  - Over‑binding → rigidity; cannot adapt to new differences

## Network mapping

Three rows reflect S/V/A perspectives of the same modulator.

| Modulator (axis) | Network construct (Target)   | Interface/API example        |
|------------------|------------------------------|------------------------------|
| ψA (Structure)   | Schema/version binding       | SchemaBinder, ContractVersionPin |
| ψA (Void)        | Retry/timeout coherence      | RetryPolicy, TimeoutHedge    |
| ψA (Awareness)   | Clock/phase/consensus sync   | NTPSync, Heartbeat, RaftStep |

## Domain Mapping

- Physics: phase locking; coherence length maintained
- Chemistry: oscillating reactions synchronized (e.g., BZ reaction)
- Biology: circadian and neural rhythm synchronization
- Social: show up consistently; shared routines keep ties strong
- Economy: rollover/renewal keeps positions/contracts alive
- Politics: coalition discipline; message cadence coherence
- Networks: clock sync (NTP/PTP); consensus steady state
- Cognition: spaced repetition and sleep consolidate memory
