# ∇S — Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient (Structure)

> Structural modulator that **amplifies differentiation** and **deepens recursive embedding**.
> Shapes boundary sharpness and hierarchical depth where Forms can emerge.

---

## Definition

∇S controls the **rate and direction of structural differentiation**.
It biases how quickly a raw difference (∆) is **embedded** and **stratified** into finer sub‑structure, influencing boundary clarity and depth (`n`) in $R^n(∆_0)$.

---

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Embedding bias: higher effective $∇S$ increases feasible depth $n$ in $F_n = ⊚(R^n(∆_0))$ under fixed $λV, ψA$ constraints

---

## Base constants (core dependencies)

- ε — sets minimal resolvable difference (resolution threshold)
- π — closure geometry for folding
- e — natural scaling rate for recursive expansion
- φ — asymmetric stabilization bias (prevents stalling)

---

## Role in the loop

- Where: Structure
- Modulates: boundary formation, hierarchical depth, feature/identity separation
- Enables: finer partitioning without collapse, provided $λV$ and $ψA$ support it

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Monotonicity: raising ∇S increases differentiation pressure
- Saturation: beyond a threshold, added ∇S yields diminishing depth gains
- Coupling: safe operation requires adequate $λV$ (receptivity) and $ψA$ (coherence)
- Failure modes:
  - Over‑differentiation → fragmentation (too many brittle sub‑forms)
  - Under‑differentiation → blur (boundaries never resolve)

## Network mapping

Three rows reflect S/V/A perspectives of the same modulator.

| Modulator (axis)   | Network construct (Target)        | Interface/API example              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| ∇S (Structure)     | Partitioning/segmentation bias    | ShardKey, NamespacePolicy          |
| ∇S (Void)          | Exposure granularity at interfaces| EndpointRouter, RateLimitBySegment |
| ∇S (Awareness)     | Identity/schema differentiation   | TypeSystem, IdentityClassifier     |

## Cross-domain examples

- Human interactions / society: clearer role titles/teams (more distinct responsibilities)
- Money / economy: finer product/market segmentation; more granular accounts
- Cognition: refining a concept into sub‑categories (“bird” → “songbird” → “finch”)
