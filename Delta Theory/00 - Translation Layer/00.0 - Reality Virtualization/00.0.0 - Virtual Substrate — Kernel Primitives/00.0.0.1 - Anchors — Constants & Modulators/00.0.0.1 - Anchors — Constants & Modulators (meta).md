# 00.0.0.1 - Anchors — Constants & Modulators (meta)

> Canonical anchors: numeric constants and SVA modulators. This index is unstable and will change as subfolders/notes are added.

---

## Purpose

Group **constants** (π, e, φ) and **modulators** (∇S, λV, ψA) that anchor the kernel across domains.

---

## Ordering policy (folder index)

- Constants first, then modulators
  - Kernel constants (5): ε, π, e, φ, c
    - ε — global quantum of difference (meta‑constant)
    - π, e, φ — structural geometry/growth/asymmetry
    - c — max propagation speed (concept; domain instances carry values)
  - Domain/derived constants live in their domains (link only from here)
- Modulators (S/V/A) listed after constants in S → V → A order

If UI sort needs to reflect this order, add numeric prefixes to filenames.

## Constants — kernel (5) and tiers

| Anchor | Tier | Dimension | One‑line role |
|---|---|---|---|
| [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]] | Fundamental/core | dimension quantum | Minimal actionable difference; global resolution/threshold |
| [[π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)]] | Mathematical core | dimensionless | Closure geometry; rotation/wave structure |
| [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)]] | Mathematical core | dimensionless | Natural growth/decay; exponential/log base |
| [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)]] | Structural ratio | dimensionless | Asymmetric stabilization/proportion |
| [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)]] | Conceptual core (value in domains) | speed | Max difference propagation speed through Void |

---

## Modulators — SVA triad

| Modulator | Axis | One‑line role |
|---|---|---|
| [[∇S — Sarkisian Differentiation Gradient (Structure)]] | S (Structure, P+) | Regulates structural differentiation and boundary sharpening |
| [[λV — Volozhina Resonance Threshold (Void)]] | V (Void, P-) | Thresholding/resonance across gaps; permits/blocks propagation |
| [[ψA — Aiza Phase Coherence Anchor (Awareness)]] | A (Awareness, P0) | Phase coherence and identity retention across loops |

Polarity mapping: Structure → P+, Void → P-, Awareness → P0.

## Scope and placement

- This folder holds cross‑domain anchors only (used broadly across domains and layers). Physics‑specific anchors (α, ħ, k_B, …) live in the Physics domain; link only.
- Domain‑specific anchors live under their own domain packages, e.g.:
  - `10 - Implementation Layer/10.2 - Domain Applications/Physics/Anchors/…`
  - `10 - Implementation Layer/10.2 - Domain Applications/Cognition/Anchors/…`
- Link outward from here; do not duplicate notes. Maintain one canonical note per anchor.

---

## Non‑core candidates and placement

- Mathematical/topological invariants (consider as references, not core anchors):
  - Euler characteristic (χ), tetrahedral closure factor, τ∆ (embedding invariance)
  - House under math/formalization or informational layer; link from here if needed
- Flow/thermo parameters (contextual, not core constants):
  - Entropy gradient S∆ and similar are model parameters; keep in domain specs

Domain physics anchors (examples; not core):
- [[c — Speed of Light in Vacuum (constant)|c — Physics instance]]
- [[ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)|ħ — Reduced Planck Constant]]
- [[k_B — Boltzmann Constant (constant)|k_B — Boltzmann Constant]]
