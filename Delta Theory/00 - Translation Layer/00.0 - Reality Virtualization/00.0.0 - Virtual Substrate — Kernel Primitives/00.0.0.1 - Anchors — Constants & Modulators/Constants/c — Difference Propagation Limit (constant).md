# c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)

> Maximum speed at which a difference can travel through the relational field.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: c
- Conceptual name: Difference Propagation Limit
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: the limiting propagation speed for signals/differences across Void

---

## Instances (domain bindings)

- Physics: [[c — Speed of Light in Vacuum (constant)|c — Speed of Light in Vacuum]]

---

## Notes

- Setting c = 1 (natural units) is a convenience; doesn’t derive the concept.
