# c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)

> Maximum speed at which a difference can travel through the relational field.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: c
- Conceptual name: Difference Propagation Limit
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: the limiting propagation speed for signals/differences across Void

---

## Derivation from Base Constants

c emerges from **A2 — Asymmetry (axiom)** as a propagation constraint:

**From A2:** Difference has inherent directionality creating field gradients
- Asymmetric propagation requires **finite speed limits** to maintain causal structure
- c represents the maximum rate at which differences can propagate through the relational field
- **Physical instantiation:** Speed of light ($c = 299,792,458$ m/s) in physics domains

**Axiom Foundation:** A2's directional field dynamics necessitate propagation limits to prevent causal paradoxes.

## Dual‑register mapping (concept)

Map the constant into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Speed limit | Channel capacity | `MaxThroughput` |
| Update bound | Refresh rate | `MaxUpdateRate` |
| Latency floor | Minimum delay | `MinLatency` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Speed limit | Integration capacity | How fast we can absorb change |
| Update bound | Processing rhythm | Natural pause between thoughts |
| Latency floor | Response time | Quickest possible reaction |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Channel limit | Absorption rate | Maximum flow of difference |
| Update cycle | Process rhythm | Natural pace of change |
| Min delay | Response gap | Irreducible separation |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Light speed | Causal horizon |
| Chemistry | Reaction speed | Process timing |
| Biology | Signal velocity | Response time |
| Social | Information flow | Understanding pace |
| Economy | Transaction speed | Market response |
| Politics | Change rate | Adaptation pace |
| Networks | Bandwidth limit | Processing bound |
| Cognition | Neural delay | Reaction time |

## Anchor role

- Sets fundamental limit on difference propagation speed
- Establishes causality and update order in systems
- Creates horizons of possible interaction

---

## Scope & invariance

- Universal limit across all domains
- Manifests as specific speed/rate limits in each context
- Setting c = 1 (natural units) is a convenience; doesn't derive the concept

---

## Interplay with SVA (if relevant)

- ∇S: limits rate of structural differentiation
- λV: bounds field propagation speed
- ψA: constrains phase alignment timing

## Instances (domain bindings)
