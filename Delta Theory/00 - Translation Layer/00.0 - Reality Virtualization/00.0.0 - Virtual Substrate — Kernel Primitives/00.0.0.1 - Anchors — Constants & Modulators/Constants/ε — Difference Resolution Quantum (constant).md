# ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)

> Minimal perceivable or actionable unit of difference; sets the system’s structural “pixel size.”

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: ε
- Conceptual name: Difference Resolution Quantum
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: smallest unit of difference that can propagate across an interface without collapsing

---

## Formal identity (concept)

Domain instantiations:

- Physics: $\varepsilon_{phys} \equiv h$ (or $\hbar$), with $E = h\,\nu$
- Computing: $\varepsilon_{info} \equiv 1\,\text{bit}$, distinguishing 2 states $\log_2 2 = 1$

---

## Anchor role

- Sets the granularity at which differences are countable/actionable
- Normalizes thresholds, sampling, and minimal transactions across domains

---

## Scope & invariance

- ε is a conceptual anchor; concrete value is domain‑specific
- Physics: fixed by fundamental constants and units
- Computing: fixed by encoding and channel model
- Choose ε explicitly per domain to avoid category errors

---

## Interplay with SVA (if relevant)

- ∇S (Structure): chooses partitioning granularity; finer ε → deeper feasible embeddings
- λV (Void): ε sets the minimum signal that clears the gate
- ψA (Awareness): ε informs memory/time‑step needed to retain a difference

---

## Examples (concept)

- Physics: photon energy $E = h\,\nu$ — one quantum difference at frequency $\nu$
- Computing: a single bit flip toggles system state; minimal stored/communicated difference
- Markets (analogy): minimum tick size as ε for price movement

---

## Instances (domain bindings)

- Physics: [[ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)|ħ — Reduced Planck Constant]]
- Computing: 1 bit — minimal informational difference unit

---
