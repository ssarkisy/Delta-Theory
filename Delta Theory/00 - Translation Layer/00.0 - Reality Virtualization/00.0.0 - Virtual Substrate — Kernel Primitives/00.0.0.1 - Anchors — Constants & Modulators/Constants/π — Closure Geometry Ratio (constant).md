# π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)

> Governs the proportional geometry of stable loops and recursive containment.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: π
- Conceptual name: Closure Geometry Ratio
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers)
- Definition: canonical closure ratio for circular containment; generalizes to rotational measure in embeddings

## Dual‑register mapping (concept)

Map the constant into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Closure | Cycle completion | `CycleCounter` |
| Rotation | Phase angle | `PhaseRotator` |
| Containment | Boundary metric | `BoundaryRatio` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Closure | Sense of completion | When a cycle feels "whole" |
| Rotation | Natural rhythm | Full turn of the seasons |
| Containment | Holding space | Creating a safe container |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Cycle count | Completion sense | When difference returns home |
| Phase angle | Natural rhythm | How cycles measure time |
| Boundary ratio | Container shape | How space holds form |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Wave period | Resonant cycles |
| Chemistry | Orbital shells | Molecular harmony |
| Biology | Growth cycles | Life rhythms |
| Social | Feedback loops | Community cycles |
| Economy | Market cycles | Value rhythms |
| Politics | Policy cycles | Cultural periods |
| Networks | Protocol rounds | System heartbeat |
| Cognition | Memory loops | Thought cycles |

## Formal identity (concept)

- Math instance (Euclidean): $\pi = C/D$; series/integral forms standard

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes circular/rotational structures (angles, spectra, modes)
- Bridges geometry and analysis (Fourier basis, harmonic cycles)

---

## Scope & invariance

- Dimensionless; concept applies across embeddings; numeric value belongs to math instances

---

## Interplay with SVA (if relevant)

- ∇S: shapes discretization of rotational features (mode counts)
- λV: resonance thresholds in angular/radial terms
- ψA: phase alignment expressed over \(2\pi\) cycles

---

## Instances (domain bindings)

- Math (Euclidean): [[π — Circle Constant (constant)|π — Circle Constant]]
- Signal processing: $2\pi$ phase turn per cycle
