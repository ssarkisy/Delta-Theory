# π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)

> Governs the proportional geometry of stable loops and recursive containment.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: π
- Conceptual name: Closure Geometry Ratio
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers)
- Definition: canonical closure ratio for circular containment; generalizes to rotational measure in embeddings

---

## Formal identity (concept)

- Math instance (Euclidean): $\pi = C/D$; series/integral forms standard

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes circular/rotational structures (angles, spectra, modes)
- Bridges geometry and analysis (Fourier basis, harmonic cycles)

---

## Scope & invariance

- Dimensionless; concept applies across embeddings; numeric value belongs to math instances

---

## Interplay with SVA (if relevant)

- ∇S: shapes discretization of rotational features (mode counts)
- λV: resonance thresholds in angular/radial terms
- ψA: phase alignment expressed over \(2\pi\) cycles

---

## Instances (domain bindings)

- Math (Euclidean): [[π — Circle Constant (constant)|π — Circle Constant]]
- Signal processing: $2\pi$ phase turn per cycle
