# φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)

> Encodes the bias toward one attractor over another; determines if form tips toward propagation or absorption.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: φ
- Conceptual name: Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio
- Conceptual value: conceptual (math instance carries number)
- Definition: positive root of $x^2 = x + 1$; limit of consecutive Fibonacci ratios (math instance)

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes asymmetric partitioning and self‑similar structuring
- Guides bias in recursive transitions (propagation vs absorption)
