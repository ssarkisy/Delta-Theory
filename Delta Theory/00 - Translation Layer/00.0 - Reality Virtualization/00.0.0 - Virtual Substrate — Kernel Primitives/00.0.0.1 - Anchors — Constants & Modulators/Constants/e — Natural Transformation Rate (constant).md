# e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)

> Sets the baseline rate for unconstrained growth, decay, or change in recursive forms.

---

## Definition (concept)

- Symbol: e
- Conceptual name: Natural Transformation Rate
- Conceptual value: conceptual (math instance carries number)
- Definition: base of the natural logarithm; limit of continuous compounding

---

## Formal identity (concept)

- Math instance: $e = \lim_{n \to \infty} (1 + 1/n)^n$

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes exponential growth/decay processes and continuous compounding
- Fundamental to differential equations and stability analysis

---

## Scope & invariance

- Dimensionless; cross‑domain applicability via math instances

---

## Instances (domain bindings)

- Math: [[e — Euler’s Number (constant)|e — Euler’s Number]]
