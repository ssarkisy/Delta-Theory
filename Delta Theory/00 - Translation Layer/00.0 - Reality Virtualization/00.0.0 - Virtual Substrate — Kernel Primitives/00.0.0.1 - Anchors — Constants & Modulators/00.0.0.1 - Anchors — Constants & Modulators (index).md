# 00.0.0.1 - Anchors — Constants & Modulators (index)

> Canonical anchors that stabilize the kernel: core constants (ε, π, e, φ, c) and SVA modulators (∇S, λV, ψA).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the fundamental anchors that stabilize Delta Theory across domains:

- **Core Constants:** Five irreducible numbers (ε, π, e, φ, c) that emerge from axioms
- **SVA Modulators:** Three control parameters (∇S, λV, ψA) that tune system behavior
- **Emergence Patterns:** How constants arise from axioms and interact
- **Domain Mappings:** How anchors manifest in specific fields

These anchors work together to provide stable reference points for both technical implementation and humane understanding.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Core Constants | Primary numeric anchors | [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)]], [[π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)]], [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)]], [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)]], [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)]] |
| SVA Modulators | Control parameters | [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)]], [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)]], [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)]] |
| Axiom Emergence | Source relationships | A1 → ε, A2 → {φ, c}, A3 → {e, π} |
| Domain Instances | Field-specific versions | Physics (α, ħ, k_B), Biology (rates, capacities), Networks (limits, bounds) |

Each anchor provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Emergence patterns
- Domain manifestations
- Implementation guidelines

### Placement Guidelines

1. **Core Anchors**
   - Constants and modulators defined here
   - Full technical/humane mappings
   - Clear emergence patterns

2. **Domain Instances**
   - Live in respective domains
   - Link back to core anchors
   - Preserve structural roles

3. **Implementation Strategy**
   - Start with core constants
   - Add modulators as needed
   - Maintain dual-register clarity
