# 00.0.0.1 - Anchors — Constants & Modulators (index)

> Canonical anchors: numeric constants and SVA modulators that stabilize the kernel across domains.

---

## Scope

Group **constants** (ε, π, e, φ, c) and **modulators** (∇S, λV, ψA) that anchor the kernel across domains.

---

## Anchors & Emergence

Constants emerge from core axioms:

| Axiom | Primary constant | Emergent constant |
|-------|-----------------|------------------|
| A1 (Irreducibility) | ε (quantum) | - |
| A2 (Asymmetry) | φ (bias) | c (limit) |
| A3 (Recursivity) | e (rate) | π (closure) |

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the anchors into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Anchor type | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Constants | Model parameters | `MIN_STEP`, `MAX_RATE` |
| Modulators | Control knobs | `DepthControl`, `GatePolicy` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Anchor type | Humane construct | Example |
|------------|------------------|---------|
| Constants | Natural limits | "Smallest we can notice" |
| Modulators | Living rhythms | "How ready we feel" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Parameter | Natural limit | What bounds difference |
| Control knob | Living rhythm | How difference flows |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Constants manifest as | Modulators manifest as |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Physics | Natural constants | Field strengths |
| Chemistry | Reaction rates | Catalytic conditions |
| Biology | Growth limits | Regulatory signals |
| Social | Group size limits | Trust thresholds |
| Economy | Market bounds | Control levers |
| Politics | Voting thresholds | Policy dials |
| Networks | System limits | Control planes |
| Cognition | Memory bounds | Attention gates |

## Constants — Core Five

| Constant | Role | Technical aspect | Humane aspect |
|----------|------|-----------------|---------------|
| [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (constant)\|ε]] | Minimal quantum | Precision limit | Smallest care |
| [[π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)\|π]] | Closure ratio | Cycle completion | Natural rhythm |
| [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)\|e]] | Growth rate | Update frequency | Life's tempo |
| [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)\|φ]] | Bias ratio | Resource split | Fair sharing |
| [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (constant)\|c]] | Speed limit | Channel capacity | Integration pace |

## Modulators — SVA Triad

| Modulator | Polarity | Technical aspect | Humane aspect |
|-----------|----------|-----------------|---------------|
| [[∇S — Structure Differentiation Gradient (Sarkisian)\|∇S]] | P+ | Partitioning depth | Boundary clarity |
| [[λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)\|λV]] | P- | Gate threshold | Readiness state |
| [[ψA — Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (Aiza)\|ψA]] | P0 | Phase coherence | Shared rhythm |

## Placement Policy

1. Core constants and modulators live here
2. Domain-specific instances live in their domains:
   - Physics: `α`, `ħ`, `k_B`, etc.
   - Biology: growth rates, carrying capacities
   - Networks: throughput limits, latency bounds
3. Link from here, don't duplicate

---

## Non-core Candidates

Mathematical invariants (reference only):
- Euler characteristic (χ)
- Tetrahedral factor (τ∆)
- Topological indices

Domain physics examples:
- [[c — Speed of Light in Vacuum (constant)|c — Physics instance]]
- [[ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)|ħ]]
- [[k_B — Boltzmann Constant (constant)|k_B]]
