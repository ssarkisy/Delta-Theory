# Form (F)

> **Form** is the **stabilized configuration of embedded difference** — a coherent unit capable of persistence and interaction.

---

## Formal identity

$$
F := ⊚(R(∆)) \quad ; \quad F_n := ⊚(R^n(∆_0))
$$

---

## Role in the loop

- Materializes Structure from embedded difference
- Projects into Void via interfaces; receives perturbation/feedback
- Is maintained by Awareness through phase coherence and memory

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Closure integrity (loop strength, boundary conditions)
- Coherence (phase alignment, identity retention)
- Persistence under perturbation (resilience)

---

## Network mapping

| Primitive concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|-------------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| F                 | Stabilized session/identity | Session, IdentityTracker |

## Cross-domain examples

- Human interactions / society: a lasting friendship/partnership forms
- Money / economy: a contract/position exists in your account
- Cognition: a concept you can recall and use across situations
