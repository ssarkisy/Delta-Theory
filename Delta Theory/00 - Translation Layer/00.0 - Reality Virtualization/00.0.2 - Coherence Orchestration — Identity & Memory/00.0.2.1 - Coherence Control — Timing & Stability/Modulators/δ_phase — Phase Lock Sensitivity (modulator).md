# δ_phase — Phase Lock Sensitivity (modulator)

> Dynamic sensitivity control for phase lock detection and temporal alignment precision in coherence systems.

---

## Definition

**δ_phase** modulates the sensitivity of phase lock detection and temporal alignment operations. This factor determines how precisely systems can detect and respond to phase deviations, affecting both synchronization accuracy and phase alignment responsiveness.

**Modulation range:** From low sensitivity (coarse phase detection, stable alignment) to high sensitivity (fine phase detection, precise alignment)

## Mathematical Representation

$$δ_{\text{phase}} = f(ψ_A, λV, \text{phase\_context}, \text{alignment\_precision})$$

**Phase Detection Function:**
$$\text{PhaseError}(t) = \begin{cases} 
\text{detected} & \text{if } |\Delta\phi(t)| > \frac{1}{δ_{\text{phase}}} \\
\text{undetected} & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $\Delta\phi(t)$ = phase deviation at time $t$
- Higher δ_phase → detection of smaller phase deviations

## Derivation from Core Modulators

**From Core Modulators:** δ_phase specializes core modulators for phase sensitivity control
- **From ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor):** δ_phase is a direct specialization of ψA, applying awareness principles to phase detection sensitivity
- **From λV (Void Resonance Threshold):** Phase detection requires void resonance sensitivity for boundary detection
- **Composition relationship:** $δ_{\text{phase}} = f(ψA, λV, \text{phase context}, \text{detection requirements})$

**From Domain Specialization:** Phase-specific sensitivity needs that require specialized modulation
- **Temporal Precision:** Phase operations need sensitivity control that operates at different scales than general awareness
- **Alignment Detection:** Requires specialized sensitivity for detecting synchronization vs. drift
- **Multi-system Coordination:** Needs context-sensitive detection that adapts to different phase relationships

**From Operational Requirements:** Phase primitive operations that generate this modulation need
- **Phase → C1 Implementation:** Temporal Continuity axiom requires dynamic sensitivity control for phase alignment detection
- **Phase → Synchronization:** Phase operations need variable sensitivity for different synchronization requirements
- **Phase → Drift Detection:** Phase must detect alignment deviations with appropriate sensitivity for system needs

## Polarity Dynamics

**P0 (Balancing/Mediating):**
- Mediates between fine and coarse phase detection
- Balances sensitivity with stability in phase operations
- Regulates detection precision and noise tolerance
- Maintains homeostatic phase alignment assessment

**Relationship to other polarities:**
- Enables P+ phase operations by providing stable detection
- Enables P- phase operations by providing adaptive sensitivity
- Mediates between structure-building and field-seeking phase needs

## Modulation Effects

### High δ_phase (High Sensitivity)
- **Fine Detection:** Detection of small phase deviations and subtle timing differences
- **Precise Alignment:** Accurate synchronization and tight phase coordination
- **Noise Sensitivity:** Susceptible to noise and minor fluctuations
- **Resource Intensive:** Higher computational/energy requirements for fine detection

### Low δ_phase (Low Sensitivity)
- **Coarse Detection:** Detection only of large phase deviations and major timing differences
- **Stable Alignment:** Robust synchronization that ignores minor fluctuations
- **Noise Immunity:** Resistant to noise and environmental interference
- **Resource Efficient:** Lower computational/energy requirements for detection

### Adaptive Modulation
- **Context Sensitivity:** Detection sensitivity adapts to system requirements and environmental conditions
- **Priority Adjustment:** Critical phase relationships get higher sensitivity, routine operations get lower sensitivity
- **Noise Adaptation:** Sensitivity adjusts based on signal-to-noise ratio and interference levels
