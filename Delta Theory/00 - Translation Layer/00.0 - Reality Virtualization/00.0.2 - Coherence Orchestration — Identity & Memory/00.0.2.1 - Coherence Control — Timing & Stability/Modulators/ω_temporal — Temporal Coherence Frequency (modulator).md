# ω_temporal — Temporal Coherence Frequency (modulator)

> Dynamic frequency control for temporal coherence patterns and identity persistence rhythms across system timescales.

---

## Definition

**ω_temporal** modulates the characteristic frequencies at which temporal coherence patterns operate and repeat. This factor determines the timescales and rhythmic patterns of coherence maintenance, affecting both identity persistence cycles and temporal coordination frequencies.

**Modulation range:** From low frequency (slow coherence cycles, long timescales) to high frequency (fast coherence cycles, short timescales)

## Mathematical Representation

$$ω_{\text{temporal}} = f(ψ_A, \text{system\_scale}, \text{coherence\_requirements}, \text{environmental\_timing})$$

**Temporal Coherence Pattern:**
$$\text{Coherence}(t) = A \cdot \cos(ω_{\text{temporal}} \cdot t + \phi) + \text{baseline}$$

Where:
- $A$ = coherence amplitude
- $\phi$ = phase offset
- Higher ω_temporal → faster coherence cycles and shorter timescales

## Derivation from Core Modulators

**From Core Modulators:** ω_temporal specializes core modulators for temporal frequency control
- **From ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor):** ω_temporal extends ψA principles to characteristic frequency selection and temporal rhythm control
- **From π (Closure Geometry Ratio):** Temporal frequencies involve cyclical patterns, deriving from π-based geometric relationships
- **Composition relationship:** $ω_{\text{temporal}} = f(ψA, π, \text{temporal context}, \text{frequency requirements})$

**From Domain Specialization:** Temporal-specific frequency needs that require specialized modulation
- **Rhythm Coordination:** Temporal systems need frequency control that operates independently of general awareness patterns
- **Scale Matching:** Requires specialized modulation for matching temporal frequencies to system characteristics
- **Coherence Timing:** Needs frequency control that adapts to coherence maintenance requirements and environmental rhythms

**From Operational Requirements:** Phase and Memory primitive operations that generate this modulation need
- **Phase → C1 Implementation:** Temporal Continuity axiom requires dynamic frequency control for identity persistence rhythms
- **Memory → Temporal Patterns:** Memory operations need frequency control for temporal pattern formation and retrieval
- **System → Rhythm Management:** Systems must coordinate temporal frequencies across multiple coherence processes

## Polarity Dynamics

**P+ (Active/Structure-building):**
- Actively generates temporal rhythm patterns from internal oscillators
- Builds coherence frequency structures through autonomous timing mechanisms
- Creates self-contained temporal coordination systems
- Operates from temporal autonomy rather than external timing dependence

**Domain Examples:**
- **Technical:** CPU clock generators creating stable processing rhythms from internal oscillators
- **Biological:** Circadian pacemakers generating internal biological rhythms independent of external cues
- **Social:** Institutional rhythms creating organizational timing patterns from internal coordination
- **Physical:** Atomic oscillators providing stable frequency references from internal quantum transitions

## Modulation Effects

### High ω_temporal (High Frequency)
- **Fast Coherence:** Rapid coherence checking and maintenance cycles
- **Short Timescales:** System operates on brief temporal intervals
- **Quick Response:** Fast adaptation to temporal changes and requirements
- **Energy Intensive:** Higher energy consumption for frequent coherence operations

### Low ω_temporal (Low Frequency)
- **Slow Coherence:** Extended coherence checking and maintenance cycles
- **Long Timescales:** System operates on extended temporal intervals
- **Stable Patterns:** Persistent temporal patterns with slow evolution
- **Energy Efficient:** Lower energy consumption for infrequent coherence operations

### Adaptive Modulation
- **Scale Matching:** Frequency adapts to system size and characteristic timescales
- **Context Sensitivity:** Temporal frequency adjusts based on environmental timing and system requirements
- **Load Balancing:** Multiple temporal frequencies for different coherence aspects and system components
