# γ_recovery — Recovery Gain Factor (modulator)

> Dynamic gain factor that controls the strength and responsiveness of recovery responses to perturbations and stability threats.

---

## Definition

**γ_recovery** modulates the gain (amplification) of recovery responses when systems detect perturbations or deviations from coherent states. This factor determines how strongly systems respond to stability threats, affecting both response magnitude and recovery effectiveness.

**Modulation range:** From low gain (gentle responses, gradual recovery) to high gain (strong responses, rapid recovery)

---

## Mathematical Representation

$$γ_{\text{recovery}} = f(∇S, ψ_A, \text{perturbation\_magnitude}, \text{system\_resilience})$$

**Recovery Response Function:**
$$\text{Response}(P) = γ_{\text{recovery}} \cdot \text{Stabilizer}(P) \cdot \text{DetectionSignal}(P)$$

Where:
- $P$ = perturbation magnitude
- Higher γ_recovery → stronger response to detected perturbations

## Derivation from Core Modulators

**From Core Modulators:** γ_recovery specializes core modulators for recovery gain control
- **From ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient):** γ_recovery extends ∇S principles to recovery response differentiation and amplification
- **From ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor):** Recovery responses require temporal coherence for effective stabilization
- **Composition relationship:** $γ_{\text{recovery}} = f(∇S, ψA, \text{recovery context}, \text{response requirements})$

**From Domain Specialization:** Recovery-specific gain needs that require specialized modulation
- **Response Strength:** Recovery systems need gain control that operates independently of general structure differentiation
- **Perturbation Sensitivity:** Requires specialized modulation for scaling responses to threat magnitude
- **System Protection:** Needs response strength that adapts to system vulnerability and recovery capacity

**From Operational Requirements:** Stabilizer primitive operations that generate this modulation need
- **Stabilizer → C3 Implementation:** Recovery Stability axiom requires dynamic gain control for effective stabilization
- **Stabilizer → Response Scaling:** Stabilizer operations need variable gain for appropriate response magnitude
- **Stabilizer → System Protection:** Stabilizer must adjust response strength based on threat assessment and system resilience

## Polarity Dynamics

**P- (Structural/Field-seeking):**
- Seeks external resources for recovery response amplification
- Creates field connections for mobilizing recovery resources
- Establishes outflow patterns for threat detection and response coordination
- Operates from recovery need rather than internal resilience capacity

**Domain Examples:**
- **Technical:** Load balancing systems scaling response capacity through distributed resources
- **Biological:** Immune systems amplifying responses through cytokine signaling networks
- **Social:** Emergency response systems mobilizing community resources for crisis recovery
- **Physical:** Feedback control systems increasing correction signals through amplification networks

## Modulation Effects

### High γ_recovery (Strong Gain)
- **Rapid Response:** Quick, strong responses to detected perturbations
- **Effective Correction:** Powerful stabilization that quickly counters threats
- **Potential Overshoot:** Risk of overcorrection and system oscillation
- **Resource Intensive:** High energy/resource consumption during recovery

### Low γ_recovery (Gentle Gain)
- **Gradual Response:** Slower, gentler responses to detected perturbations
- **Stable Correction:** Measured stabilization that avoids overcorrection
- **Potential Undershoot:** Risk of insufficient response to serious threats
- **Resource Efficient:** Lower energy/resource consumption during recovery

### Adaptive Modulation
- **Threat Scaling:** Response gain adapts to perturbation magnitude and urgency
- **System State:** Gain adjusts based on current system health and resilience capacity
- **Learning Integration:** Past recovery experiences inform gain calibration
