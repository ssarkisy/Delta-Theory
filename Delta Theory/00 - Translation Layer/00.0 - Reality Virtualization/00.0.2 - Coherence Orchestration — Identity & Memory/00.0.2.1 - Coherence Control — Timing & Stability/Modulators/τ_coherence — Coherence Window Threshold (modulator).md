# τ_coherence — Coherence Window Threshold (modulator)

> Dynamic threshold that sets temporal windows for coherence detection and stability assessment across all coherence operations.

---

## Definition

**τ_coherence** modulates the temporal windows within which coherence is detected, measured, and maintained. This threshold determines how tight or loose the coherence requirements are, affecting phase lock sensitivity, memory consolidation windows, recovery detection timing, and stability assessment periods.

**Modulation range:** From tight coherence windows (high precision, low tolerance) to loose coherence windows (low precision, high tolerance)

## Mathematical Representation

$$\tau_{\text{coherence}} = f(\psi_A, \text{system\_state}, \text{coherence\_demand})$$

**Window Function:**
$$W_{\text{coherence}}(t) = \begin{cases} 
1 & \text{if } |\Delta_{\text{coherence}}(t)| \leq \tau_{\text{coherence}} \\
0 & \text{otherwise}
\end{cases}$$

Where:
- $\Delta_{\text{coherence}}(t)$ = coherence deviation at time $t$
- Window determines when coherence operations are active vs. inactive

## Derivation from Core Modulators

**From Core Modulators:** τ_coherence specializes core modulators for coherence window control
- **From ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor):** τ_coherence is a direct specialization of ψA, applying awareness principles to window threshold control
- **From λV (Void Resonance Threshold):** Coherence windows require void resonance detection for boundary stability
- **Composition relationship:** $τ_{\text{coherence}} = f(ψA, λV, \text{coherence context}, \text{temporal requirements})$

**From Domain Specialization:** Coherence-specific window needs that require specialized modulation
- **Temporal Precision:** Coherence operations need window control that operates at different scales than general awareness
- **Stability Detection:** Requires specialized threshold modulation for detecting coherence vs. incoherence
- **Multi-scale Coordination:** Needs context-sensitive windows that adapt to different coherence timescales

**From Operational Requirements:** Coherence primitive operations that generate this modulation need
- **All Coherence Axioms (C1-C3):** Temporal Continuity, Memory Coherence, and Recovery Stability all require window threshold control
- **Multi-primitive Coordination:** Coherence windows must coordinate across Phase, Memory, Selector, and Stabilizer operations
- **System-wide Coherence:** Coherence thresholds must maintain system-level coherence across all subsystems

## Polarity Dynamics

**P0 (Balancing/Mediating):**
- Mediates between tight and loose coherence requirements
- Balances precision with tolerance in coherence detection
- Regulates coherence window timing and sensitivity
- Maintains homeostatic coherence assessment

**Relationship to other polarities:**
- Enables P+ coherence operations by providing stable windows
- Enables P- coherence operations by providing flexible boundaries
- Mediates between structure-building and field-seeking coherence needs

## Modulation Effects

### High τ_coherence (Loose Windows)
- **Phase Management:** Tolerant phase lock, flexible timing coordination
- **Memory Operations:** Broad consolidation windows, pattern flexibility
- **Recovery Processes:** Relaxed stability criteria, gradual restoration
- **Stability Assessment:** Loose convergence criteria, adaptive thresholds

### Low τ_coherence (Tight Windows)  
- **Phase Management:** Strict phase lock, precise timing coordination
- **Memory Operations:** Narrow consolidation windows, pattern precision
- **Recovery Processes:** Strict stability criteria, rapid restoration
- **Stability Assessment:** Tight convergence criteria, precise thresholds

### Adaptive Modulation
- **Context Sensitivity:** Windows adapt to system state and environmental conditions
- **Temporal Scaling:** Different windows for different coherence timescales
- **Priority Adjustment:** Critical operations get tighter windows, routine operations get looser windows
