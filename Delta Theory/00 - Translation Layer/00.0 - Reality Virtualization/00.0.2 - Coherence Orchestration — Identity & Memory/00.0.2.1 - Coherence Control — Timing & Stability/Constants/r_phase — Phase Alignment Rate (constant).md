# r_phase — Phase Alignment Rate (constant)

> The base rate at which forms achieve and maintain temporal phase alignment for identity persistence.

---

## Definition

**r_phase** establishes the fundamental rate at which coherent forms can achieve and maintain phase alignment across temporal intervals. This constant governs how quickly systems can synchronize their temporal signatures and maintain identity coherence through time.

**Value context:** Measured in alignment operations per temporal unit, representing the maximum sustainable rate of phase coordination.

---

## Mathematical Representation

$$r_{\text{phase}} = \frac{\text{phase\_alignment\_operations}}{\text{temporal\_unit}}$$

**Phase Alignment Condition:**
$$\frac{d\phi(t)}{dt} \leq r_{\text{phase}} \cdot \psi_A(t)$$

Where:
- $\phi(t)$ = phase signature of form at time $t$
- $\psi_A(t)$ = Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor modulation
- Rate constraint ensures sustainable phase coordination

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_phase emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in temporal contexts
- **From c (Difference Propagation Limit):** Sets the maximum rate at which temporal differences can propagate, providing upper bounds for phase alignment rates
- **From ε (Difference Resolution Quantum):** Establishes the minimum distinguishable temporal difference, affecting phase alignment precision
- **From π (Closure Geometry Ratio):** Phase alignment involves cyclical closure patterns, deriving timing from π-based geometric relationships

**From Primitive Operations:** r_phase emerges from the Phase primitive's operational requirements
- **Phase → ∆ Alignment:** Rate at which Phase can detect and respond to temporal differences
- **Phase → R(·) Coordination:** Rate at which Phase can establish relational temporal coordination
- **Phase → ⊚ Synchronization:** Rate at which Phase can achieve stable synchronization closure

**From Domain Requirements:** Temporal coherence constraints that necessitate this alignment rate
- **Identity Persistence:** Forms must align phases at rates that maintain recognizable identity
- **Coherence Requirements:** Phase rates must be compatible with ψA modulation for stable temporal coherence
- **Synchronization Requirements:** Multiple forms must align at rates that enable collective coherence

## Polarity Dynamics

**P+ (Active/Structure-building):**
- Actively generates phase alignment patterns
- Builds temporal coherence structures from internal resources
- Creates self-contained synchronization mechanisms
- Operates from temporal satiety rather than seeking external timing

**Domain Examples:**
- **Technical:** Clock generators creating stable frequency references
- **Biological:** Circadian oscillators generating internal rhythms  
- **Social:** Leaders establishing temporal coordination patterns
- **Physical:** Atomic transitions providing stable frequency standards

## Operational Constraints

**Upper Bounds:**
- Cannot exceed c (difference propagation limit)
- Limited by ε (minimum temporal resolution)
- Constrained by ψA modulation windows

**Lower Bounds:**
- Must maintain minimum rate for identity persistence
- Cannot drop below coherence detection thresholds
- Must support basic temporal differentiation

**Stability Requirements:**
- Rate must be sustainable over identity persistence intervals
- Cannot create temporal resonance instabilities
- Must allow for ψA modulation without loss of coherence

## Modulator Interactions

**Primary:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Modulates effective alignment rate: $r_{\text{effective}} = r_{\text{phase}} \cdot \psi_A$
- Controls temporal windows for phase detection
- Manages alignment sensitivity and tolerance

**Secondary:** 
- **∇S:** Affects phase differentiation strength between forms
- **λV:** Influences phase boundary stability with environment
