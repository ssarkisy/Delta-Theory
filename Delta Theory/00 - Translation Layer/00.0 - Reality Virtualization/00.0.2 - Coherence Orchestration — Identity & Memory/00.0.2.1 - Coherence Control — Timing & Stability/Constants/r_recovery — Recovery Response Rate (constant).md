# r_recovery — Recovery Response Rate (constant)

> The base rate at which systems can detect perturbations and initiate stabilization responses for coherence restoration.

---

## Definition

**r_recovery** establishes the fundamental rate at which coherent systems can detect deviations from stable states and initiate recovery responses. This constant governs how quickly systems can mobilize stabilization mechanisms and begin restoration processes after perturbations.

**Value context:** Measured in recovery operations per temporal unit, representing the sustainable rate of perturbation response and stabilization initiation.

---

## Mathematical Representation

$$r_{\text{recovery}} = \frac{\text{recovery\_operations}}{\text{temporal\_unit}}$$

**Recovery Response Condition:**
$$\frac{d}{dt}\text{Stabilizer}(P(t)) \leq r_{\text{recovery}} \cdot \psi_A(t)$$

Where:
- $\text{Stabilizer}(P(t))$ = stabilization response to perturbation $P(t)$
- $\psi_A(t)$ = Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor modulation
- Rate constraint ensures sustainable recovery response

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_recovery emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in stabilization contexts
- **From e (Natural Transformation Rate):** Recovery involves natural transformation processes, deriving response rates from e-based exponential restoration patterns
- **From φ (Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio):** Recovery requires asymmetric response between perturbation and restoration, deriving timing from φ-based response ratios
- **From c (Difference Propagation Limit):** Recovery responses must propagate faster than perturbation spread, deriving upper bounds from c-based propagation limits

**From Primitive Operations:** r_recovery emerges from the Stabilizer primitive's operational requirements
- **Stabilizer → ∆ Detection:** Rate at which Stabilizer can detect destabilizing differences
- **Stabilizer → R(·) Response:** Rate at which Stabilizer can establish relational recovery patterns
- **Stabilizer → ⊚ Restoration:** Rate at which Stabilizer can achieve stability closure

**From Domain Requirements:** Recovery constraints that necessitate this response rate
- **Perturbation Response:** Systems must respond at rates that prevent coherence loss
- **Stability Requirements:** Recovery rates must restore coherence within stability windows
- **Resilience Requirements:** Response rates must support system resilience under stress

## Polarity Dynamics

**P- (Structural/Field-seeking):**
- Seeks external resources for recovery processes
- Creates field connections to mobilize restoration
- Establishes outflow patterns for error detection and response
- Operates from stability need rather than internal resilience

**Domain Examples:**
- **Technical:** Distributed systems seeking redundant resources for fault recovery
- **Biological:** Immune systems mobilizing responses through signaling networks
- **Social:** Communities seeking mutual aid during crisis recovery
- **Physical:** Materials seeking equilibrium through thermal and structural networks

## Operational Constraints

**Upper Bounds:**
- Cannot exceed perturbation detection and response capacity
- Limited by available stabilization resources
- Constrained by ψA modulation windows

**Lower Bounds:**
- Must maintain minimum rate for stability preservation
- Cannot drop below perturbation response thresholds
- Must support basic recovery differentiation

**Stability Requirements:**
- Rate must be sustainable over recovery operation intervals
- Cannot create recovery response oscillations
- Must allow for gradual stabilization without overshoot

## Modulator Interactions

**Primary:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Modulates effective recovery rate: $r_{\text{effective}} = r_{\text{recovery}} \cdot \psi_A$
- Controls temporal windows for perturbation detection
- Manages recovery response sensitivity and timing

**Secondary:**
- **γ_recovery:** Controls recovery response strength and gain
- **σ_stability:** Affects stability margins and recovery thresholds
