# 00.0.2.1 - Coherence Control — Timing & Stability (meta)

> Control parameters for temporal coherence: phase timing, memory retention, recovery rates, and stability windows.
> Specialized constants and modulators that govern coherence orchestration dynamics.

---

## Scope

Coherence control manages temporal stability through:
1. **Phase timing constants** - rates of temporal alignment
2. **Memory retention parameters** - information persistence patterns  
3. **Recovery rate controls** - stability restoration timing
4. **Stability window modulators** - coherence tolerance boundaries

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Coherence Constants | Fixed rates | [[r_phase — Phase Alignment Rate (constant)]], [[r_memory — Memory Consolidation Rate (constant)]], [[r_recovery — Recovery Response Rate (constant)]], [[r_stability — Stability Convergence Rate (constant)]] |
| Coherence Modulators | Dynamic controls | [[τ_coherence — Coherence Window Threshold (modulator)]], [[β_memory — Memory Retention Factor (modulator)]], [[γ_recovery — Recovery Gain Factor (modulator)]], [[δ_phase — Phase Lock Sensitivity (modulator)]], [[σ_stability — Stability Margin Control (modulator)]], [[ω_temporal — Temporal Coherence Frequency (modulator)]] |
| Operational Flow | Coherence sequence | Phase (timing) → Memory (retention) → Recovery (response) → Stability (convergence) |

## Polarity Alignment

**Coherence control follows polarity-based coordination:**
- **P+ Constants:** r_phase (P+), r_stability (P+) - active temporal structure building
- **P- Constants:** r_memory (P-), r_recovery (P-) - field-seeking information patterns
- **P0 Modulators:** τ_coherence (P0), δ_phase (P0), σ_stability (P0) - balancing controls
- **P+/P- Modulators:** β_memory (P-), γ_recovery (P-), ω_temporal (P+) - specialized controls

---

## Primary Modulator Relationships

**ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)** - Primary modulator for all coherence timing:
- Sets temporal windows for coherence detection
- Controls phase lock sensitivity and memory retention
- Manages recovery timing and stability convergence rates

**Secondary Modulator Influences:**
- **∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient):** Identity differentiation in coherence patterns
- **λV (Void Resonance Threshold):** Coherence boundary stability with environmental fields

## Operational Dynamics

### Phase Management
- **r_phase** sets base rate of temporal alignment operations
- **δ_phase** modulates sensitivity to phase deviations
- **ω_temporal** controls coherence frequency matching

### Memory Coherence
- **r_memory** sets base rate of memory consolidation
- **β_memory** modulates retention strength and pattern selection
- **τ_coherence** sets coherence windows for memory operations

### Recovery Coordination  
- **r_recovery** sets base rate of stability restoration
- **γ_recovery** modulates recovery response strength
- **σ_stability** controls stability margins and tolerance

### Stability Maintenance
- **r_stability** sets base rate of convergence to stable states
- **τ_coherence** sets windows for stability detection
- **σ_stability** modulates acceptable deviation bounds
