# 00.0.2 - Coherence Orchestration — Identity & Memory (meta)

> How forms maintain identity through time: phase alignment, synchronization, and memory.
> Orchestrates the rhythms and cycles that enable persistent structure.

## Scope

The coherence layer manages temporal stability through:

1. **Coherence Axioms** - foundational principles for temporal stability
2. **Coherence Control** - timing and stability control parameters
3. **Coherence Primitives** - basic operations for coherence management
4. **Recovery Orchestration** - perturbation response and stability restoration

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the coherence layer into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Coherence concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Phase lock | Clock sync | `PLL`, `NTPSync` |
| Memory | State retention | `Cache`, `Journal` |
| Selection | Path choice | `Selector`, `Router` |
| Recovery | Fault handling | `Retry`, `Failover` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Coherence concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|----------|
| Phase lock | Shared rhythm | Dancing together |
| Memory | Living history | "We remember this" |
| Selection | Choice making | "This feels right" |
| Recovery | Healing | "Finding balance again" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock sync | Shared rhythm | How cycles align |
| State | Living memory | What persists |
| Selection | Recognition | What matters |
| Recovery | Healing | Return to balance |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Phase coherence | Natural rhythm |
| Chemistry | Reaction timing | Chemical dance |
| Biology | Circadian sync | Life cycles |
| Social | Meeting cadence | Group harmony |
| Economy | Settlement cycle | Value rhythm |
| Politics | Policy cycle | Power pulse |
| Networks | Protocol timing | System beat |
| Cognition | Memory trace | Mind's time |

## Core Operations

The coherence layer provides four key operations:

1. **Phase Management**
   - Technical: Clock sync, jitter control
   - Humane: Rhythm finding, entrainment

2. **Memory Consolidation**
   - Technical: State journaling, checkpointing
   - Humane: Experience integration, learning

3. **Path Selection**
   - Technical: Route optimization, load balancing
   - Humane: Choice making, recognition

4. **Stability Recovery**
   - Technical: Fault tolerance, retry logic
   - Humane: Adaptation, healing

---

## Stability Conditions

Key invariants that must be maintained:

| Condition | Technical aspect | Humane aspect |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Phase lock | Clock sync | Shared rhythm |
| Memory | State consistency | Story coherence |
| Selection | Path stability | Choice clarity |
| Recovery | Error bounds | Healing capacity |

---

## Modulator Influence

Coherence is primarily shaped by ψA (Awareness phase):

| Aspect | ψA influence |
|--------|-------------|
| Phase | Sets sync window |
| Memory | Controls retention |
| Selection | Guides recognition |
| Recovery | Manages adaptation |

Secondary influences:
- ∇S: Identity differentiation
- λV: Interface stability

## ψA Modulation Examples

The Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (ψA) orchestrates temporal stability and memory:

### Phase Lock Management
- **High ψA:** Tight phase coherence, strong synchronization
  - Technical: Low jitter tolerance, precise clock sync
  - Humane: Deep attunement, synchronized presence
- **Low ψA:** Loose phase tolerance, flexible timing
  - Technical: High jitter tolerance, async operations
  - Humane: Relaxed coordination, flowing interaction

### Memory Consolidation Control
- **ψA calibration** affects retention patterns:
  - `ψA↑`: Selective memory, high-fidelity traces
  - `ψA↓`: Broad memory, pattern recognition focus

### Path Selection Sensitivity
- **ψA influence** on choice recognition:
  - High ψA: Clear recognition, decisive selection
  - Low ψA: Distributed attention, exploratory choice

### Recovery Orchestration
- **ψA modulation** shapes adaptive response:
  - Technical: Error handling sophistication
  - Humane: Healing process refinement

## Recovery Protocols

Systematic approaches to stability restoration:

### Phase Recovery
1. **Detection:** Monitor phase drift beyond tolerance
2. **Isolation:** Identify desynchronized components
3. **Resynchronization:** Gradual phase lock restoration
4. **Validation:** Confirm stable coherence
5. **Learning:** Update phase management parameters

### Memory Recovery
1. **Corruption Detection:** Identify inconsistent state
2. **Rollback:** Restore to last known good state
3. **Replay:** Re-execute operations from checkpoint
4. **Verification:** Validate memory consistency
5. **Consolidation:** Strengthen memory traces

### Selection Recovery
1. **Choice Paralysis:** Detect selection deadlock
2. **Context Refresh:** Update recognition parameters
3. **Path Exploration:** Sample alternative routes
4. **Commitment:** Make provisional selection
5. **Feedback Integration:** Learn from selection outcome

### Coherence Recovery
1. **Fragmentation Detection:** Identify loss of unity
2. **Component Gathering:** Collect scattered elements
3. **Alignment Process:** Re-establish connections
4. **Integration:** Restore holistic function
5. **Stabilization:** Strengthen coherence anchors

## Design rationale

The coherence layer must be intelligible in both technical and humane registers per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Each aspect maintains its dual nature without reduction to either register.
