# Stabilizer (primitive)

> Recovery coordination primitive that orchestrates stability restoration and coherence recovery through balanced feedback mechanisms.

---

## Definition

**Stabilizer** is the primitive operation that coordinates recovery processes and stability restoration, orchestrating the return to coherent states through balanced feedback mechanisms and recovery response coordination.

**Core operation:** Recovery coordination through balanced feedback and stability restoration orchestration for coherence maintenance.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
Stabilizer emerges from structural primitives applied to recovery and stability contexts:

1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Perturbation differences requiring stabilization response
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Recovery patterns embedded in feedback relationships
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Recovery closure and stability achievement
4. **F (Form):** Stable coherent forms emerging from recovery processes

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{perturbation} \rightarrow R(recovery\_pattern) \rightarrow ⊚_{stabilization} \rightarrow F_{restored\_coherence}$

## Core Operations

### Primary Functions
1. **Perturbation Detection:** Identifying deviations from coherent states
2. **Response Coordination:** Orchestrating recovery mechanisms and feedback processes
3. **Stability Restoration:** Guiding systems back to coherent attractors
4. **Recovery Integration:** Consolidating recovery outcomes for sustained stability

### Operational Characteristics
- **Balanced Response:** Mediates between correction intensity and system stability
- **Feedback Orchestration:** Coordinates multiple recovery mechanisms and responses
- **Attractor Guidance:** Directs systems toward stable coherent states
- **Resilience Building:** Strengthens system capacity for future perturbation handling

---

## Polarity Dynamics

**P0 (Balancing/Mediating):**
- Mediates between perturbation forces and restoration forces
- Balances recovery response intensity with system stability requirements
- Regulates feedback timing and correction coordination
- Maintains homeostatic recovery processes

**Relationship to other polarities:**
- Coordinates with P+ Phase operations for temporal recovery alignment
- Coordinates with P- Memory operations for pattern-based recovery guidance
- Works with P0 Selector operations for recovery path selection

## Modulator Interactions

**Primary:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Controls temporal windows for perturbation detection and recovery timing
- Manages stabilization sensitivity and response coordination
- Coordinates recovery processes with other coherence operations

**Secondary:**
- **γ_recovery:** Controls recovery response gain and correction intensity
- **σ_stability:** Sets stability margins and convergence criteria for recovery
- **r_recovery:** Provides base rate for recovery response operations

---

## Axiom Implementation

**Implements C3 — Recovery Stability:**
- Provides the operational mechanism for stability restoration through balanced feedback
- Enables coherent recovery from perturbations and system deviations
- Coordinates recovery processes that return systems to stable attractors

**Integrates with C1 and C2:**
- Uses temporal continuity (C1) for recovery timing and coordination
- Uses memory coherence (C2) for recovery pattern guidance and learning
