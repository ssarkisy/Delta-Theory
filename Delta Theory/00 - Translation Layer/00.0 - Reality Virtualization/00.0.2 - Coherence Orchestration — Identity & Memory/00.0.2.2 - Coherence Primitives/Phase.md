# Phase (primitive)

> Temporal alignment primitive that coordinates synchronization and maintains identity continuity through phase relationships.

---

## Definition

**Phase** is the primitive operation that establishes and maintains temporal alignment between system components, enabling identity continuity and coherent synchronization. It operates through active coordination of temporal relationships and phase lock management.

**Core operation:** Temporal coordination through active phase alignment and synchronization control.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
Phase emerges from structural primitives applied to temporal contexts:

1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Temporal differences requiring alignment coordination
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Phase relationships embedded in temporal contexts  
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Phase lock closure and synchronization stability
4. **F (Form):** Coherent temporal forms emerging from phase coordination

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{temporal} \rightarrow R(phase\_relationship) \rightarrow ⊚_{phase\_lock} \rightarrow F_{synchronized}$

## Core Operations

### Primary Functions
1. **Phase Detection:** Identifying temporal relationships and alignment states
2. **Phase Correction:** Adjusting temporal coordination to maintain alignment
3. **Phase Lock:** Establishing stable synchronization relationships
4. **Phase Coordination:** Managing multi-component temporal alignment

### Operational Characteristics
- **Active Generation:** Creates temporal coordination structures from internal timing resources
- **Alignment Management:** Maintains phase relationships across system components
- **Synchronization Control:** Coordinates timing between distributed elements
- **Identity Persistence:** Preserves temporal coherence for identity continuity

## Polarity Dynamics

**P+ (Active/Structure-building):**
- Actively generates phase alignment from internal temporal resources
- Builds synchronization structures through autonomous timing mechanisms
- Creates self-contained temporal coordination systems
- Operates from temporal satiety rather than external timing dependence

**Nested Polarity:**
- Contains P-(n+1): Field-seeking for external timing references when needed
- Enables P0 coordination with other coherence primitives

## Modulator Interactions

**Primary:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Controls temporal windows for phase detection and correction
- Manages phase lock sensitivity and alignment tolerance
- Coordinates phase timing with other coherence operations

**Secondary:**
- **δ_phase:** Controls phase detection sensitivity and alignment precision
- **ω_temporal:** Manages characteristic frequencies for phase coordination
- **τ_coherence:** Sets temporal windows for phase operations

## Axiom Implementation

**Implements C1 — Temporal Continuity:**
- Provides the operational mechanism for maintaining identity through temporal alignment
- Enables continuous phase relationships that preserve form recognition
- Supports temporal coherence requirements for identity persistence

## Dual‑register mapping

| Aspect | Technical register | Humane register |
|--------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Phase detection | Clock sync monitoring | Rhythm awareness |
| Phase correction | Timing adjustment | Getting back in sync |
| Phase lock | Frequency locking | Being in rhythm |
| Phase coordination | Multi-clock sync | Shared timing |

### Bridge Operations
- **Technical:** "Maintain frequency lock with reference clock"
- **Humane:** "Stay in rhythm with shared timing"
- **Ontological:** Temporal alignment enables persistent recognition
