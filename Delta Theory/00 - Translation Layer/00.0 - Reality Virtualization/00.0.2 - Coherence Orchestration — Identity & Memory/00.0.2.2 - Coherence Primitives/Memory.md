# Memory (primitive)

> Information persistence primitive that embeds patterns in relational networks and maintains coherence across state transitions.

---

## Definition

**Memory** is the primitive operation that establishes and maintains information persistence through relational embedding, enabling pattern retention and coherent information access across system state changes.

**Core operation:** Information persistence through relational embedding and pattern maintenance in network structures.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
Memory emerges from structural primitives applied to information persistence contexts:

1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Information differences requiring persistent storage patterns
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Information patterns embedded in relational network structures
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Memory pattern closure and retention stability  
4. **F (Form):** Persistent information forms emerging from memory operations

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{information} \rightarrow R(memory\_pattern) \rightarrow ⊚_{retention} \rightarrow F_{persistent\_memory}$

## Core Operations

### Primary Functions
1. **Pattern Formation:** Creating stable information patterns in relational networks
2. **Pattern Retention:** Maintaining information patterns across time and state changes
3. **Pattern Access:** Retrieving stored information patterns when needed
4. **Pattern Consolidation:** Strengthening important memory patterns for long-term retention

### Operational Characteristics
- **Relational Embedding:** Stores information through network relationship patterns
- **Field-seeking Storage:** Seeks external relational networks for information embedding
- **Pattern Persistence:** Maintains information coherence across system changes
- **Selective Retention:** Prioritizes important patterns while allowing decay of less critical information

---

## Polarity Dynamics

**P- (Structural/Field-seeking):**
- Seeks relational networks for information embedding and storage
- Creates field connections for memory access and retrieval
- Establishes outflow patterns for information sharing and access
- Operates from information preservation need rather than internal storage capacity

**Nested Polarity:**
- Contains P+(n+1): Structure-building within memory patterns for stability
- Enables P0 coordination with selection and stabilization primitives

## Modulator Interactions

**Primary:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Controls temporal windows for memory consolidation and retrieval
- Manages memory formation timing and retention parameters
- Coordinates memory operations with other coherence processes

**Secondary:**
- **β_memory:** Controls memory retention strength and pattern persistence
- **r_memory:** Sets base rate for memory consolidation operations
- **τ_coherence:** Manages temporal windows for memory operations

## Axiom Implementation

**Implements C2 — Memory Coherence:**
- Provides the operational mechanism for information persistence through relational embedding
- Enables coherent information access across state transitions
- Supports relational network requirements for memory coherence

## Operational Constraints

**Requirements:**
- Must embed patterns in stable relational network structures
- Cannot exceed r_memory rate limits for sustainable consolidation
- Must maintain coherence through β_memory retention parameters

**Capabilities:**
- Can store complex information patterns in distributed networks
- Can maintain information access across diverse system states
- Can selectively strengthen or weaken memory patterns based on importance

## Interaction Patterns

**With Phase:** Memory operations must coordinate with temporal alignment for coherent consolidation
**With Selector:** Memory provides patterns for selection guidance and choice making
**With Stabilizer:** Memory patterns support recovery operations and stability restoration
