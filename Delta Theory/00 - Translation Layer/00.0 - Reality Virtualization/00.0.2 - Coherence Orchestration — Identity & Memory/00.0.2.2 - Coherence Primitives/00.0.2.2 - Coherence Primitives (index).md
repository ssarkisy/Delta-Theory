# 00.0.2.2 - Coherence Primitives (meta)

> Basic operations for temporal coherence management: phase coordination, memory persistence, selection guidance, and stability restoration.
> Core primitives that implement coherence axioms through fundamental operations.

---

## Scope

Coherence primitives provide fundamental operations for:
1. **Phase coordination** - temporal alignment and synchronization
2. **Memory persistence** - information pattern retention and access
3. **Selection guidance** - choice making and path selection  
4. **Stability restoration** - recovery and coherence maintenance

---

## Primitive Overview

| Primitive | Polarity | Core Function | Primary Axiom |
|-----------|----------|---------------|---------------|
| Phase | P+ | Temporal alignment and synchronization coordination | C1 — Temporal Continuity |
| Memory | P- | Information pattern retention and relational embedding | C2 — Memory Coherence |
| Selector | P0 | Path selection and choice guidance coordination | C3 — Recovery Stability |
| Stabilizer | P0 | Recovery response and stability restoration coordination | C3 — Recovery Stability |

---

## Operational Flow

**Coherence operations follow polarity-based sequence:**
**Phase (P+) → Memory (P-) → Selector (P0) → Stabilizer (P0)**

This flow enables:
1. **Phase** establishes temporal coordination structure
2. **Memory** embeds patterns in relational networks
3. **Selector** guides choices for coherence maintenance
4. **Stabilizer** orchestrates recovery and stability restoration

---

## Primitive Derivation

**All coherence primitives derive from structural primitives:**
- **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Temporal differences requiring coherence management
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Coherence patterns embedded in relational contexts
- **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Coherence closure and stability achievement
- **F (Form):** Coherent forms emerging from temporal operations

**Applied to coherence contexts:**
$∆_{temporal} \rightarrow R(coherence\_pattern) \rightarrow ⊚_{stability} \rightarrow F_{coherent}$

---

## Polarity Coordination

**Coherence primitives operate through polarity rotation:**
- **P+ (Phase):** Actively generates temporal coordination structures
- **P- (Memory):** Seeks relational networks for pattern embedding
- **P0 (Selector/Stabilizer):** Mediates between different coherence requirements

**Stable Polarity Dynamics:**
- Phase creates temporal structure for Memory embedding
- Memory provides patterns for Selector choice guidance
- Selector coordinates with Stabilizer for recovery operations
- Stabilizer maintains conditions enabling Phase coordination

## Primary Modulator Relationships

**ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)** - Primary modulator for all coherence primitives:
- **Phase:** Controls temporal alignment windows and synchronization sensitivity
- **Memory:** Manages consolidation timing and retention parameters
- **Selector:** Influences choice timing and selection criteria
- **Stabilizer:** Controls recovery timing and response coordination

**Secondary Modulator Influences:**
- **∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient):** Affects coherence pattern differentiation
- **λV (Void Resonance Threshold):** Influences coherence boundary stability

## Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Phase lock | Being in sync | How time aligns |
| Memory trace | Living story | What persists |
| Path selection | Choice recognition | What matters |
| Stability response | Healing action | Return to balance |
