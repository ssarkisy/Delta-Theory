# C1 — Temporal Continuity (axiom)

> Forms maintain identity through continuous phase alignment across temporal intervals.

---

## Statement

**All persistent forms require continuous temporal alignment to maintain identity coherence.**

Every form that persists through time must maintain phase coherence between its current state and its identity pattern. This continuity is not static preservation but active phase alignment that accommodates change while preserving essential form characteristics.

---

## Mathematical Formulation

For any form $F$ persisting through time interval $[t_1, t_2]$:

$$\exists \psi_A(t) : \forall t \in [t_1, t_2], \text{phase}(F(t)) \sim \text{phase}(F(t_0)) \pm \psi_A$$

Where:
- $\psi_A$ = Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor (temporal tolerance window)
- $\text{phase}(F(t))$ = Form's phase signature at time $t$
- $\sim$ denotes coherence within tolerance bounds

---

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Temporal differences create the need for continuity management
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Identity patterns embedded in relational contexts persist through time
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Phase alignment creates stable temporal closure
4. **F (Form):** Identity forms require temporal coherence to remain recognizable

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{temporal} \rightarrow R(\text{identity\_pattern}) \rightarrow ⊚_{\text{phase\_lock}} \rightarrow F_{\text{continuous}}$

## Dependencies & scope

**Dependent on:** Core axioms A1-A3
**Independent of:** Other coherence axioms C2, C3

**Scope:** All forms that persist through temporal intervals
**Domain:** Universal - applies across all domains where identity persistence occurs

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

1. **Phase Lock Requirements:** All persistent forms must maintain phase coherence within ψA bounds
2. **Identity Drift Limits:** Forms can change while maintaining identity only within phase tolerance
3. **Continuity Breaks:** Loss of phase alignment results in identity discontinuity or form dissolution
4. **Temporal Boundaries:** Forms exist only within intervals where phase alignment is maintainable

## Dual‑register mapping

| Concept | Technical register | Humane register |
|---------|-------------------|-----------------|
| Phase alignment | Clock synchronization | Staying in rhythm |
| Identity pattern | State signature | "Who we are" |
| Temporal coherence | Time-series consistency | Life continuity |
| Phase lock | Frequency matching | Being in sync |

### Crosswalk
**Technical:** "Clock sync maintains system identity"
**Humane:** "Staying in rhythm preserves who we are"
**Bridge:** Phase alignment enables persistent recognition
