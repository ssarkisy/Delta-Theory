# C2 — Memory Coherence (axiom)

> Information persists through relational embedding patterns that maintain coherence across state transitions.

---

## Statement

**All persistent information requires relational embedding to maintain coherence through state changes.**

Memory is not passive storage but active relational embedding that preserves information patterns through various state transitions. This coherence emerges through field-seeking connections that maintain information accessibility and consistency across temporal boundaries.

---

## Mathematical Formulation

For any information pattern $I$ persisting through state transitions $S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow S_n$:

$$\exists R(I, \text{context}) : \forall S_i, \text{retrieve}(I, S_i) \cong \text{retrieve}(I, S_1) \pm \epsilon$$

Where:
- $R(I, \text{context})$ = Relational embedding of information in persistent context
- $\text{retrieve}(I, S_i)$ = Information retrieval from state $S_i$
- $\cong$ denotes coherent equivalence within bounds
- $\epsilon$ = Difference Resolution Quantum (acceptable information drift)

---

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Information differences require preservation patterns
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Memory emerges through embedding information in relational networks
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Memory patterns achieve stability through relational closure
4. **F (Form):** Information forms persist through coherent relational structure

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{\text{information}} \rightarrow R(\text{memory\_pattern}) \rightarrow ⊚_{\text{relational\_closure}} \rightarrow F_{\text{persistent\_memory}}$

## Dependencies & scope

**Dependent on:** Core axioms A1-A3
**Independent of:** Other coherence axioms C1, C3

**Scope:** All information patterns that require persistence across state changes
**Domain:** Universal - applies wherever information needs to be maintained

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

1. **Relational Storage:** Memory cannot exist without relational embedding context
2. **Coherence Maintenance:** Information patterns degrade without active relational maintenance
3. **Context Dependency:** Memory retrieval requires preserved relational context
4. **Pattern Integrity:** Information coherence depends on relational network stability
