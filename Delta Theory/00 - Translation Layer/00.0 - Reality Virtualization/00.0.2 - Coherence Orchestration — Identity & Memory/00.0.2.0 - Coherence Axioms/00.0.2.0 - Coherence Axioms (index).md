# 00.0.2.0 - Coherence Axioms (meta)

> Foundational truths about temporal stability and identity persistence in recursive systems.
> These axioms govern how forms maintain coherence through time and change.

---

## Scope

Coherence axioms establish the fundamental principles for:
1. Temporal stability maintenance
2. Identity persistence through change  
3. Memory and state coherence
4. Recovery from perturbations

---

## Axiom Overview

| Axiom | Name | Polarity | Core Principle |
|-------|------|----------|----------------|
| C1 | Temporal Continuity | P+ | Forms maintain identity through continuous phase alignment |
| C2 | Memory Coherence | P- | Information persists through relational embedding patterns |
| C3 | Recovery Stability | P0 | Systems return to coherence through stabilization feedback |

---

## Axiom Mapping | Primitive grounding

All axioms apply to all coherence primitives with different emphasis:
- **C1 (Temporal Continuity)** emphasizes Phase and Memory operations
- **C2 (Memory Coherence)** emphasizes Memory and Selector operations  
- **C3 (Recovery Stability)** emphasizes Stabilizer and Phase operations

---

## Operational Flow

Coherence operations follow polarity-based sequence:
**Phase (P+) → Memory (P-) → Selector (P0) → Stabilizer (P0)**

---

## Dependencies & Derivation

**Coherence Axioms derive from Core Axioms:**
- C1 ← A3 (Recursivity): Temporal continuity through recursive self-maintenance
- C2 ← A1 (Irreducibility): Memory patterns that cannot be reduced without loss
- C3 ← A2 (Asymmetry): Recovery through asymmetric feedback mechanisms

**Coherence Axioms derive from Structural Primitives:**
- All coherence axioms emerge from: ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F
- Applied to temporal stability contexts

---

## Modulator Influence

Primary modulator: **ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)**
- Sets temporal windows for coherence detection
- Controls memory retention parameters
- Manages recovery response timing

Secondary modulators:
- **∇S**: Identity differentiation strength
- **λV**: Coherence boundary stability
