# C3 — Recovery Stability (axiom)

> Systems return to coherence through stabilization feedback that balances perturbation and restoration.

---

## Statement

**All coherent systems possess inherent recovery mechanisms that restore stability through balanced feedback loops.**

Every coherent system contains stabilization mechanisms that detect deviations from coherence and orchestrate return to stable states. This recovery emerges through balanced feedback that mediates between destabilizing perturbations and stabilizing responses.

---

## Mathematical Formulation

For any coherent system $S$ experiencing perturbation $P(t)$:

$$\exists \text{Stabilizer}(S) : \lim_{t \to \infty} |S(t) - S_{\text{coherent}}| \leq \delta$$

Where:
- $\text{Stabilizer}(S)$ = System's inherent stabilization mechanism
- $S_{\text{coherent}}$ = System's coherent state attractor
- $\delta$ = Acceptable deviation bound
- Recovery occurs through: $P_{\text{perturbation}} \rightarrow \text{Feedback} \rightarrow P0_{\text{balance}} \rightarrow \text{Stability}$

## Primitive Derivation

**From Structural Primitives:**
1. **∆ (Primitive Difference):** Perturbations create differences requiring stabilization
2. **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Recovery patterns embedded in system relationships
3. **⊚ (Stabilization/Closure):** Active stabilization creates recovery closure
4. **F (Form):** Stable forms emerge from successful recovery processes

**Emergence Path:**
$∆_{\text{perturbation}} \rightarrow R(\text{feedback\_pattern}) \rightarrow ⊚_{\text{stabilization}} \rightarrow F_{\text{recovered\_coherence}}$

---

## Dependencies & scope

**Dependent on:** Core axioms A1-A3
**Requires:** C1 and C2 (temporal continuity and memory coherence enable recovery)

**Scope:** All systems capable of maintaining coherent states
**Domain:** Universal - applies to all self-stabilizing systems

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

1. **Inherent Stability:** All coherent systems possess intrinsic recovery mechanisms
2. **Feedback Requirements:** Recovery requires functional feedback loops for stability detection
3. **Balance Mediation:** Successful recovery balances perturbation forces with restoration forces
4. **Attractor Dynamics:** Coherent systems have stable attractors that guide recovery

## Polarity Dynamics

**P0 (Balancing/Mediating):**
- Mediates between perturbation and stability
- Balances destabilizing and stabilizing forces
- Regulates recovery timing and intensity
- Maintains homeostatic equilibrium

**Relationship to other polarities:**
- Mediates P+: Structure-building recovery mechanisms
- Mediates P-: Field-seeking error detection patterns
- Enables sustainable coherence through balanced response
