# 00.0 - Reality Virtualization (meta)

> Virtualize the ontological core into clear, operable abstractions before formal APIs.

---

## Purpose

Express ∆, R(·), ⊚, and SVA modulators using network-native terminology so they can be reasoned about and linked to domains without premature formalization.

---

## Modules

- **00.0.0 - Virtual Substrate — Kernel Primitives**
  ∆ (Difference), R(·) (Relational Embedding), ⊚ (Stabilization/Closure), Form (F); closure semantics.
  Anchor: ∇S.

- **00.0.1 - Execution Environment — Ports & Boundaries**
  Interfaces, ingress/egress, thresholds, receptivity, isolation surfaces.
  Anchor: λV.

- **00.0.2 - Coherence Orchestration — Identity & Memory**
  Phase alignment, identity retention, synchronization, persistence under perturbation.
  Anchor: ψA.

---

## Principles

- Kernel-first: stabilize primitives and modulators as a minimal [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
- Vocabulary-first: use virtualization terms to bridge into APIs later
- Stability via tags: `#status/seed` → `#status/unstable` → `#status/stable`
