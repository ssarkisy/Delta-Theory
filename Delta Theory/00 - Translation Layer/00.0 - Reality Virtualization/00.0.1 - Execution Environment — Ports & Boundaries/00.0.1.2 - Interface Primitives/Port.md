# Port (Flow Control Interface)

> **Port** is the **directional flow control primitive** — managing ingress and egress through selective admission.

---

## Definition

Port is not a static opening or channel. It is the **active flow management operation** that controls what enters and exits the structure while maintaining directional coherence.

---

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Flow control | Rate limiting | `FlowController`, `RateLimiter` |
| Directional management | Ingress/Egress | `IngressController`, `EgressFilter` |
| Selective admission | Access control | `PortFilter`, `AdmissionController` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Flow control | Measured sharing | "I share at my own pace" |
| Directional management | Giving and receiving | "What goes out, what comes in" |
| Selective admission | Welcoming choice | "I choose who enters" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Rate limiting | Paced sharing | How fast things flow |
| Ingress/Egress | In and out | Direction of exchange |
| Access control | Welcome choice | What gets through |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Ingress Control | `port.admit(flow, criteria)` | "Let this in carefully" |
| Egress Shaping | `port.emit(flow, rate)` | "Share this appropriately" |
| Flow Monitoring | `port.monitor(flow)` | "Watch what's moving" |
| Backpressure | `port.slow(flow)` | "Take a breath" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | λV Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Selectivity | Filter strictness | Trust level | High λV = more selective |
| Flow Rate | Bandwidth limit | Sharing pace | Low λV = faster flow |
| Direction | Ingress/Egress balance | Give/receive balance | λV modulates preference |
| Buffer Size | Queue depth | Patience capacity | High λV = smaller buffers |

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Electromagnetic port | Energy gateway |
| Chemistry | Reaction interface | Chemical doorway |
| Biology | Ion channel | Cell gateway |
| Social | Communication channel | Conversation opening |
| Economy | Market access point | Value exchange port |
| Politics | Legal interface | Power access point |
| Networks | Protocol port | Data gateway |
| Cognition | Attention channel | Mental doorway |

## Stability Conditions

- **Flow Conservation:** `∑(ingress) = ∑(egress) + ∆(buffer)`
- **Rate Consistency:** Flow rates remain within operational bounds
- **Direction Coherence:** Ingress/egress maintain structural orientation
- **Selection Stability:** Admission criteria remain consistent

---

## Modulator Effects

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- **High λV:** Strict admission, selective flow, quality focus
- **Low λV:** Open admission, rapid flow, quantity focus

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- Controls port boundary clarity and isolation strength

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Manages temporal flow coherence and buffer synchronization

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Port Interface:
- admit(flow, criteria) → boolean
- emit(flow, rate) → status
- monitor() → flow_state
- configure(selectivity, rate, direction)
```

### Error Conditions
- **Overload:** Flow rate exceeds capacity
- **Underflow:** Insufficient input for stability
- **Selection Failure:** Cannot apply admission criteria
- **Direction Confusion:** Ingress/egress conflict

---

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** Port → [[Gate]] → [[Buffer]] → [[Surface]]
- **Controls:** Port selectivity feeds into Gate thresholds
- **Dependencies:** Requires boundary definition from Surface

---

## Design rationale

Port follows dual-register governance so flow control remains intelligible both as technical rate limiting and as humane sharing patterns without reducing one to the other.
