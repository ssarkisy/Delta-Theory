# 00.0.1.2 - Interface Primitives (index)

> Core interface operations: Port (flow control), Gate (threshold control), Surface (boundary control), and Buffer (state retention).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the four fundamental interface primitives that enable controlled field interaction:

- **Port:** Flow control and directional management
- **Gate:** Threshold activation and condition monitoring
- **Surface:** Boundary exposure and permeability control
- **Buffer:** State retention and temporal continuity

These primitives work together in coordinated patterns to manage structure-field interaction while maintaining both technical precision and humane understanding.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Interface Primitives | Core operations | [[Port]], [[Gate]], [[Surface]], [[Buffer]] |
| Operational Flow | Interface sequence | Port (receive) → Gate (evaluate) → Buffer (retain) → Surface (expose) |
| Axiom Mapping | Grounding principles | I1 → Port, I2 → Surface, I3 → Gate, Coherence → Buffer |
| Modulator Effects | Control parameters | λV (threshold), ∇S (boundary), ψA (coherence) |

Each primitive provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Operational semantics
- Control interfaces
- Domain manifestations
