# Buffer (State Retention Interface)

> **Buffer** is the **state retention primitive** — managing memory, continuity, and temporal coherence across interface operations.

---

## Definition

Buffer is not a passive storage container or cache. It is the **active state management operation** that maintains continuity, manages memory retention, and ensures temporal coherence across interface interactions.

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| State retention | Memory management | `StateManager`, `MemoryBuffer` |
| Continuity management | Session persistence | `SessionStore`, `ContinuityManager` |
| Temporal coherence | Time-based consistency | `TemporalCache`, `CoherenceTracker` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| State retention | Living memory | "I remember this" |
| Continuity management | Story keeping | "The thread continues" |
| Temporal coherence | Consistent identity | "I remain myself over time" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Memory management | Living memory | What persists |
| Session persistence | Story keeping | How continuity flows |
| Consistency | Identity | What stays the same |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| State Retention | `buffer.store(state, duration)` | "Hold this for me" |
| Memory Retrieval | `buffer.recall(key, context)` | "What do I remember?" |
| Continuity Management | `buffer.maintain_continuity()` | "Keep the story flowing" |
| Coherence Validation | `buffer.validate_coherence()` | "Does this still make sense?" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | ψA Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Retention Duration | Memory lifespan | How long to remember | High ψA = longer retention |
| Capacity | Storage limits | Memory depth | Low ψA = shallow buffers |
| Coherence Threshold | Consistency requirements | Story integrity | ψA controls coherence standards |
| Refresh Rate | Memory updates | Story renewal | ψA manages refresh timing |

| Chemistry | Intermediate states | Chemical memory |
| Biology | Cellular memory | Living memory |

## Stability Conditions

- **State Integrity:** Stored information remains coherent and accessible
- **Temporal Consistency:** Memory maintains coherence across time
- **Capacity Management:** Storage operates within sustainable limits
- **Coherence Preservation:** Retained state supports interface identity

---

## Modulator Effects

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- **Primary control** for memory retention and temporal coherence
- **High ψA:** Long retention, high coherence, detailed memory
- **Low ψA:** Short retention, loose coherence, aggregate memory

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Controls memory selectivity and retention thresholds
- High λV: Selective retention, quality focus
- Low λV: Broad retention, quantity focus

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- Affects memory organization and retrieval precision
- High ∇S: Clear memory categories, precise retrieval
- Low ∇S: Fluid memory organization, associative retrieval

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Buffer Interface:
- store(state, duration, priority) → storage_status
- recall(key, context) → retrieved_state
- maintain_continuity() → continuity_status
- validate_coherence() → coherence_level
```

### Error Conditions
- **Memory Corruption:** Stored state becomes inconsistent or inaccessible
- **Capacity Overflow:** Storage exceeds sustainable limits
- **Coherence Loss:** Retained information loses internal consistency
- **Continuity Break:** Temporal flow becomes fragmented

## Primitive Derivation

Buffer emerges from structural primitives applied to state management:

**From ∆ (Difference):** Buffer operation begins with state difference detection
- $∆_{state}$ = differences in interface state over time
- This creates the fundamental memory capacity

**From R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Context determines what should be retained
- $R(∆_{state})$ embeds state differences in temporal and causal context
- Context shapes retention priorities and coherence requirements

**From ⊚ (Stabilization):** Memory patterns must close coherently
- $⊚(R(∆_{state}))$ = stable memory retention that maintains coherence
- Closure ensures memory serves interface stability and continuity

**From F (Form):** Interface Form requires consistent memory to maintain identity
- $F_{buffer}$ = remembering interface that maintains temporal coherence
- Form stability depends on reliable state retention

---

## Design rationale

Buffer follows dual-register governance so state retention remains intelligible both as technical memory management and as humane story keeping without reducing one to the other.
