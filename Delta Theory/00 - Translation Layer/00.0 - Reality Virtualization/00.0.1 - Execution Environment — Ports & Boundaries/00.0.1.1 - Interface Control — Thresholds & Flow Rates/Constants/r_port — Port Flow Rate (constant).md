# r_port — Port Flow Rate (constant)

> **r_port** defines the **base flow rate** for Port interface operations — the fundamental rate at which difference can cross port boundaries.

---

## Definition

r_port is not a static limit but the **characteristic flow rate** that establishes the temporal scale for port operations. It represents the natural rhythm at which ports can discriminate and admit flows while maintaining interface stability.

---

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_port emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in interface contexts
- **From c (Difference Propagation Limit):** Sets the maximum rate at which differences can propagate, providing an upper bound for port flow rates
- **From ε (Difference Resolution Quantum):** Establishes the minimum distinguishable difference that ports can discriminate, affecting the precision of flow control

**From Primitive Operations:** r_port emerges from the Port primitive's operational requirements
- **Port → ∆ Reception:** Rate at which Port can receive and distinguish incoming differences
- **Port → R(·) Embedding:** Rate at which Port can establish relational context for incoming flows
- **Port → Selection:** Rate at which Port can apply selectivity criteria (linked to I1 — Selective Permeability)

**From Domain Requirements:** Interface-specific constraints that necessitate this flow rate constant
- **Stability Requirements:** Ports must operate at rates that maintain boundary integrity while allowing controlled ingress
- **Coherence Requirements:** Flow rates must be compatible with ψA modulation to maintain temporal coherence
- **Discrimination Requirements:** Ports must process flows at rates that allow proper selectivity evaluation

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Base flow rate | Bandwidth capacity | `MaxThroughput`, `BaseRate` |
| Temporal scale | Clock frequency | `OperationFreq`, `CycleTime` |
| Discrimination rate | Processing speed | `FilterRate`, `DecisionSpeed` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Base flow rate | Natural pace | "How fast I can receive" |
| Temporal scale | Life rhythm | "My natural timing" |
| Discrimination rate | Attention speed | "How quickly I can choose" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Bandwidth | Natural pace | Flow capacity |
| Frequency | Life rhythm | Temporal scale |
| Processing speed | Attention speed | Discrimination rate |

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
r_{port} = \frac{∆_{flow}}{∆t} \Big|_{\text{natural}}
$$

Where:
- $∆_{flow}$ = unit of difference crossing the port
- $∆t$ = natural time interval for port operation
- The natural scale represents unmodulated port behavior

## Modulation Effects

### λV (Primary Modulator)
- **High λV:** Effective rate decreases (more selective → slower admission)
- **Low λV:** Effective rate increases (less selective → faster admission)
- $r_{port}^{eff} = r_{port} \cdot f(λV^{-1})$

### Secondary Effects
- **∇S:** Affects discrimination precision (sharp boundaries → clearer flow rates)
- **ψA:** Influences temporal coherence (phase alignment → stable rates)

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Field coupling rate | Energy transfer pace |
| Chemistry | Reaction site turnover | Chemical flow speed |
| Biology | Ion channel conductance | Metabolic intake rate |
| Social | Communication bandwidth | Conversation pace |
| Economy | Transaction throughput | Market flow rate |
| Politics | Policy processing rate | Decision flow pace |
| Networks | Protocol bandwidth | Data transfer rate |
| Cognition | Attention bandwidth | Information intake rate |

## Scale Effects

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- r_port approaches quantum information transfer limits
- Discrete packet transmission dominates
- Uncertainty principle constrains simultaneous flow/selectivity

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- r_port aligns with conscious attention rhythms
- Batch processing becomes efficient
- Temporal coherence requirements dominate

### Macro Scale (c-bounded)
- r_port limited by difference propagation speed
- Bulk flow dynamics emerge
- System-wide coordination requirements

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Port Rate Control:
- base_rate = r_port
- effective_rate = r_port * modulation_factor(λV, ∇S, ψA)
- flow_admission(rate) → boolean
- rate_adaptation(conditions) → new_rate
```

### Control Parameters
- **Burst Capacity:** Short-term rate multiplication factor
- **Sustained Rate:** Long-term average based on r_port
- **Backpressure Threshold:** Rate at which port begins flow control

## Related Constants

- [[r_gate — Gate Activation Rate (constant)]]: Evaluation speed for threshold crossing
- [[r_surface — Surface Permeability Rate (constant)]]: Boundary exposure rate
- [[r_buffer — Buffer Retention Rate (constant)]]: State retention timeline

---

## Design rationale

This constant follows dual-register governance ensuring port flow rates remain intelligible both as technical bandwidth and as humane pace without reducing one to the other.
