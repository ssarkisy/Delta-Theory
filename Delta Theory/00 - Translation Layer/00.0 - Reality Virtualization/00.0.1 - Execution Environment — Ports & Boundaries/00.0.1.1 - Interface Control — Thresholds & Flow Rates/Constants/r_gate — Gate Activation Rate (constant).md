# r_gate — Gate Activation Rate (constant)

> **r_gate** defines the **base evaluation rate** for Gate interface operations — the fundamental rate at which conditions can be assessed and state transitions triggered.

---

## Definition

r_gate is not a switching frequency but the **characteristic evaluation rate** that establishes the temporal scale for gate operations. It represents the natural rhythm at which gates can monitor conditions and coordinate state transitions while maintaining interface coherence.

---

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_gate emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in evaluation contexts
- **From φ (Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio):** Gate decisions require asymmetric evaluation between states, deriving timing from φ-based decision ratios
- **From ε (Difference Resolution Quantum):** Gates must evaluate differences at rates that allow proper threshold detection

**From Primitive Operations:** r_gate emerges from the Gate primitive's operational requirements
- **Gate → ∆ Evaluation:** Rate at which Gate can assess incoming differences against thresholds
- **Gate → ⊚ Stabilization:** Rate at which Gate can complete stability evaluation before state transitions
- **Gate → Decision:** Rate at which Gate can execute threshold-based decisions (linked to I3 — Flow Conservation)

**From Domain Requirements:** Threshold evaluation constraints that necessitate this activation rate
- **Decision Precision:** Gates must operate at rates that allow accurate threshold evaluation
- **Stability Requirements:** Activation rates must maintain gate state coherence during transitions
- **Response Requirements:** Gates must respond to threshold crossings at rates compatible with system dynamics

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Evaluation rate | Polling frequency | `MonitorRate`, `CheckInterval` |
| Transition speed | State change time | `SwitchTime`, `TransitionDelay` |
| Decision bandwidth | Processing capacity | `EvalThroughput`, `DecisionRate` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Evaluation rate | Readiness sensing | "How often I check" |
| Transition speed | Decision timing | "How fast I respond" |
| Decision bandwidth | Choice capacity | "How many decisions I can make" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Polling frequency | Readiness sensing | Condition monitoring rate |
| State change time | Decision timing | Transition speed |
| Processing capacity | Choice capacity | Decision bandwidth |

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
r_{gate} = \frac{∆_{condition}}{∆t} \Big|_{\text{evaluation}}
$$

Where:
- $∆_{condition}$ = unit of condition change that can be evaluated
- $∆t$ = natural time interval for gate evaluation
- The evaluation scale represents unmodulated gate sensitivity

---

## Modulation Effects

### λV (Primary Modulator)
- **High λV:** Effective rate decreases (higher thresholds → slower activation)
- **Low λV:** Effective rate increases (lower thresholds → faster activation)
- $r_{gate}^{eff} = r_{gate} \cdot f(λV^{-1})$

### ψA (Secondary Modulator)
- Controls temporal coherence of evaluation cycles
- Manages phase synchronization across multiple gates
- $r_{gate}^{sync} = r_{gate} \cdot g(ψA)$

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Energy barrier crossing rate | Natural trigger speed |
| Chemistry | Activation energy evaluation | Reaction readiness rate |
| Biology | Action potential frequency | Neural firing rate |
| Social | Decision point frequency | Group consensus rate |
| Economy | Market trigger rate | Investment decision speed |
| Politics | Policy activation rate | Legislative trigger rate |
| Networks | Protocol gate frequency | System state change rate |
| Cognition | Awareness threshold rate | Recognition frequency |

## Scale Effects

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- r_gate approaches quantum measurement limits
- Discrete state evaluation dominates
- Observer effect constrains evaluation precision

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- r_gate aligns with conscious decision rhythms
- Batch evaluation becomes efficient
- Temporal coherence requirements dominate

### Macro Scale (c-bounded)
- r_gate limited by system coordination speed
- Collective decision dynamics emerge
- Network-wide synchronization requirements

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Gate Rate Control:
- base_rate = r_gate
- effective_rate = r_gate * threshold_factor(λV) * coherence_factor(ψA)
- condition_check(rate) → evaluation_result
- transition_trigger(conditions) → state_change
```

### Control Parameters
- **Evaluation Window:** Time interval for condition assessment
- **Hysteresis Factor:** Prevents oscillation around thresholds
- **Sync Tolerance:** Acceptable phase variation for coordinated activation

## Related Constants

- [[r_port — Port Flow Rate (constant)]]: Flow admission rate for port operations
- [[r_surface — Surface Permeability Rate (constant)]]: Boundary adjustment rate
- [[r_buffer — Buffer Retention Rate (constant)]]: State change persistence rate

---

## Design rationale

This constant follows dual-register governance ensuring gate evaluation rates remain intelligible both as technical polling frequency and as humane decision timing without reducing one to the other.
