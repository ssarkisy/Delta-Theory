# r_surface — Surface Permeability Rate (constant)

> **r_surface** defines the **base permeability rate** for Surface interface operations — the fundamental rate at which boundary exposure and visibility can be adjusted.

---

## Definition

r_surface is not a static permeability but the **characteristic adjustment rate** that establishes the temporal scale for surface operations. It represents the natural rhythm at which surfaces can modify exposure, adapt boundaries, and manage interface presentation while maintaining identity coherence.

---

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_surface emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in boundary contexts
- **From π (Closure Geometry Ratio):** Surface permeability relates to closure geometry, determining how boundaries allow controlled passage
- **From c (Difference Propagation Limit):** Sets the maximum rate at which differences can cross surface boundaries

**From Primitive Operations:** r_surface emerges from the Surface primitive's operational requirements
- **Surface → ∆ Exposure:** Rate at which Surface can control what differences are exposed or concealed
- **Surface → R(·) Boundary:** Rate at which Surface can maintain relational boundaries while allowing selective permeability
- **Surface → Transparency:** Rate at which Surface can modulate transparency/opacity (linked to I2 — Boundary Integrity)

**From Domain Requirements:** Boundary control constraints that necessitate this permeability rate
- **Boundary Integrity:** Surfaces must control permeability at rates that maintain structural integrity
- **Selective Exposure:** Surfaces must modulate exposure at rates that allow proper discrimination
- **Interface Stability:** Permeability rates must maintain surface coherence during exposure transitions

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Permeability adjustment | Access control rate | `ACLUpdateRate`, `PermissionChange` |
| Exposure modification | Visibility tuning | `ExposureRate`, `VisibilityAdjust` |
| Boundary adaptation | Interface flexibility | `BoundaryAdapt`, `SurfaceModify` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Permeability adjustment | Openness tuning | "How fast I can open/close" |
| Exposure modification | Sharing adjustment | "How quickly I reveal/hide" |
| Boundary adaptation | Social flexibility | "How fast I adapt my boundaries" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Access control rate | Openness tuning | Boundary adjustment speed |
| Visibility tuning | Sharing adjustment | Exposure modification rate |
| Interface flexibility | Social flexibility | Adaptation responsiveness |

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
r_{surface} = \frac{∆_{permeability}}{∆t} \Big|_{\text{natural}}
$$

Where:
- $∆_{permeability}$ = unit change in surface permeability
- $∆t$ = natural time interval for surface adjustment
- The natural scale represents unmodulated surface responsiveness

---

## Modulation Effects

### ∇S (Primary Modulator)
- **High ∇S:** Faster adjustment rate (clear boundaries → quick adaptation)
- **Low ∇S:** Slower adjustment rate (fluid boundaries → gradual changes)
- $r_{surface}^{eff} = r_{surface} \cdot f(∇S)$

### Secondary Effects
- **λV:** Affects adjustment sensitivity (threshold for triggering changes)
- **ψA:** Influences temporal coherence (smooth vs. discrete adjustments)

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |

| Cognition | Mental boundary adjustment | Consciousness openness |

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Surface Rate Control:
- base_rate = r_surface
- effective_rate = r_surface * boundary_factor(∇S) * coherence_factor(ψA)
- permeability_adjust(target, rate) → adjustment_status
- exposure_modify(level, rate) → modification_result
```

### Control Parameters
- **Adjustment Speed:** How quickly surface properties change
- **Coherence Constraint:** Limits on rate to maintain identity
- **Adaptation Range:** Min/max bounds for permeability variation

## Related Constants

- [[r_port — Port Flow Rate (constant)]]: Flow input rate affecting surface presentation
- [[r_gate — Gate Activation Rate (constant)]]: Condition evaluation for surface changes
- [[r_buffer — Buffer Retention Rate (constant)]]: State persistence for surface memory

---

## Design rationale

This constant follows dual-register governance ensuring surface adjustment rates remain intelligible both as technical permeability control and as humane boundary adaptation without reducing one to the other.
