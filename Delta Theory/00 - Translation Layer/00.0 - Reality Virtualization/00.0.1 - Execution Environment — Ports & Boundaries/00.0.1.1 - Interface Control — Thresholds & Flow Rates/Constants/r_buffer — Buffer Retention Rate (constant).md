# r_buffer — Buffer Retention Rate (constant)

> **r_buffer** defines the **base retention rate** for Buffer interface operations — the fundamental rate at which state information can be stored and retrieved while maintaining temporal coherence.

---

## Definition

r_buffer is not a storage capacity but the **characteristic retention rate** that establishes the temporal scale for buffer operations. It represents the natural rhythm at which buffers can manage state transitions and maintain memory coherence while preserving interface identity.

---

## Derivation from Base Constants

**From Base Constants:** r_buffer emerges from the interaction of fundamental constants in retention contexts
- **From e (Natural Transformation Rate):** Buffer retention involves natural transformation processes, deriving rates from e-based exponential patterns
- **From ψA anchoring:** Buffer operations require temporal coherence, linking retention rates to awareness stability patterns

**From Primitive Operations:** r_buffer emerges from the Buffer primitive's operational requirements
- **Buffer → ∆ Retention:** Rate at which Buffer can store and maintain difference patterns
- **Buffer → R(·) Memory:** Rate at which Buffer can establish and maintain relational memory contexts
- **Buffer → ⊚ Persistence:** Rate at which Buffer can stabilize stored patterns against decay

**From Domain Requirements:** Memory and state retention constraints that necessitate this rate
- **Memory Coherence:** Buffers must retain information at rates that maintain temporal consistency
- **State Persistence:** Retention rates must balance storage capacity with stability requirements
- **Access Patterns:** Buffer rates must support both storage and retrieval operations efficiently

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Constant concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Retention rate | Memory bandwidth | `WriteRate`, `ReadThroughput` |
| State persistence | Storage durability | `RetentionTime`, `MemoryLifespan` |
| Coherence maintenance | Consistency overhead | `SyncRate`, `CoherenceCheck` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Constant concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Retention rate | Memory formation | "How fast I learn" |
| State persistence | Memory depth | "How long I remember" |
| Coherence maintenance | Story consistency | "How I keep my narrative coherent" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Memory bandwidth | Memory formation | Information retention rate |
| Storage durability | Memory depth | Persistence capacity |
| Consistency overhead | Story consistency | Coherence maintenance cost |

---

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
r_{buffer} = \frac{∆_{state}}{∆t} \Big|_{\text{retention}}
$$

Where:
- $∆_{state}$ = unit of state information that can be retained
- $∆t$ = natural time interval for buffer operation
- The retention scale represents unmodulated buffer capacity

---

## Modulation Effects

### ψA (Primary Modulator)
- **High ψA:** Enhanced retention rate (better coherence → more efficient storage)
- **Low ψA:** Reduced retention rate (loose coherence → storage overhead)
- $r_{buffer}^{eff} = r_{buffer} \cdot f(ψA)$

### Secondary Effects
- **λV:** Affects retention selectivity (high λV → quality focus)
- **∇S:** Influences memory organization (clear structure → efficient retrieval)

---

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | State storage rate | Natural memory formation |
| Chemistry | Intermediate retention | Chemical memory persistence |
| Biology | Cellular memory rate | Learning speed |
| Social | Collective memory formation | Shared story development |
| Economy | Capital accumulation rate | Value retention speed |
| Politics | Institutional memory | Policy persistence rate |
| Networks | Cache efficiency | System memory performance |
| Cognition | Memory consolidation | Learning integration rate |

## Scale Effects

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- r_buffer approaches quantum information storage limits
- Discrete state quantum dominates
- Decoherence constrains retention time

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- r_buffer aligns with consciousness memory rhythms
- Narrative coherence becomes crucial
- Pattern recognition optimizes storage

### Macro Scale (c-bounded)
- r_buffer limited by information propagation
- Distributed memory systems emerge
- System-wide coherence requirements

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Buffer Rate Control:
- base_rate = r_buffer
- effective_rate = r_buffer * coherence_factor(ψA) * selectivity_factor(λV)
- state_store(rate, data) → storage_status
- memory_retrieve(key, context) → retrieved_state
```

### Control Parameters
- **Retention Depth:** How long information persists
- **Coherence Window:** Time interval for maintaining consistency
- **Consolidation Rate:** Speed of memory strengthening

## Related Constants

- [[r_port — Port Flow Rate (constant)]]: Input rate for buffer storage
- [[r_gate — Gate Activation Rate (constant)]]: Trigger rate for buffer operations
- [[r_surface — Surface Permeability Rate (constant)]]: Exposure rate for buffer contents

---

## Design rationale

This constant follows dual-register governance ensuring buffer retention rates remain intelligible both as technical memory bandwidth and as humane learning pace without reducing one to the other.
