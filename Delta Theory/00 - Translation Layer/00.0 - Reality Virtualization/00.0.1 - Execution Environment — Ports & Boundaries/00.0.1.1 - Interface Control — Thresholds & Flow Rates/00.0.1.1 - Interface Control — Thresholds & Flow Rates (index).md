# 00.0.1.1 - Interface Control — Thresholds & Flow Rates (index)

> Control parameters and modulators that tune interface behavior: flow rates, threshold sensitivity, and boundary conditions.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the control systems that modulate interface behavior:

- **Flow Rate Constants:** Base rates for different interface types
- **Threshold Modulators:** Dynamic adjustment of activation conditions  
- **Boundary Control:** Permeability and isolation tuning
- **State Retention:** Memory and buffer management parameters

These controls work together to enable stable field interaction while maintaining structural integrity through λV, ∇S, and ψA modulation.
