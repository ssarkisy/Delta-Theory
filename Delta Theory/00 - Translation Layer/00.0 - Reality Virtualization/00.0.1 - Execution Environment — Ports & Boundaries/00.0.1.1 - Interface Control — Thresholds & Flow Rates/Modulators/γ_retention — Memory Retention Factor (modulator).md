# γ_retention — Memory Retention Factor (modulator)

> **γ_retention** modulates the **memory retention strength** of Buffer interface operations — dynamically adjusting how persistently information is stored and how selectively it is retained.

---

## Definition

γ_retention is not a fixed storage duration but a **dynamic retention modulator** that adjusts memory persistence based on importance, context, and capacity. It enables buffers to optimize memory usage while maintaining essential information coherence.

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Modulator concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Retention strength | Memory persistence | `RetentionPolicy`, `MemoryLifetime` |
| Storage selectivity | Cache management | `CacheStrategy`, `StoragePriority` |
| Memory optimization | Resource management | `MemoryOptimizer`, `RetentionManager` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Modulator concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Retention strength | Memory depth | "How deeply I remember" |
| Storage selectivity | Memory importance | "What's worth remembering" |
| Memory optimization | Mental efficiency | "Managing my mental space" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Memory persistence | Memory depth | Retention strength |
| Cache management | Memory importance | Storage selectivity |
| Resource management | Mental efficiency | Memory optimization |

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
γ_{retention}(t) = γ_0 \cdot \left(1 + η \cdot \sum_{n} v_n \cdot I_n(t)\right)
$$

Where:
- $γ_0$ = base retention factor
- $η$ = retention adaptation strength
- $v_n$ = weight for importance factor n
- $I_n(t)$ = normalized importance measure at time t

---

## Modulation Effects

### Primary Function
- **High γ_retention:** Stronger retention (longer memory persistence, higher selectivity)
- **Low γ_retention:** Weaker retention (shorter persistence, lower selectivity)
- Enables adaptive memory management based on importance and capacity

### Interaction with ψA
- ψA provides temporal coherence for memory operations
- γ_retention controls retention strength within that coherence
- $effective_{retention} = ψA \cdot γ_{retention}$

### Interface Applications
- **Buffers:** γ_retention controls state persistence and memory depth
- **Ports:** γ_retention influences flow history retention
- **Gates:** γ_retention affects condition memory and learning

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | State persistence | Natural memory formation |
| Chemistry | Molecular memory | Chemical history retention |
| Biology | Cellular memory | Living memory depth |
| Social | Collective memory | Shared story persistence |
| Economy | Value retention | Economic memory |
| Politics | Institutional memory | Policy persistence |
| Networks | Data persistence | System memory depth |
| Cognition | Memory consolidation | Learning retention |

## Control Scenarios

### Importance-Based Retention
- **High Importance:** γ_retention increases (deep, persistent storage)
- **Low Importance:** γ_retention decreases (shallow, temporary storage)
- **Critical Information:** γ_retention maximizes for essential data

### Capacity-Based Adaptation
- **High Capacity:** γ_retention can afford broad retention
- **Low Capacity:** γ_retention becomes highly selective
- **Memory Pressure:** γ_retention prioritizes most important information

### Context-Sensitive Storage
- **Learning Contexts:** γ_retention optimizes for skill development
- **Emergency Contexts:** γ_retention focuses on survival-relevant information
- **Social Contexts:** γ_retention balances personal and shared memory needs

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Memory Retention Control:
- base_retention = γ_retention_base
- information_importance = assess_content_importance()
- memory_capacity = evaluate_storage_availability()
- context_priority = assess_situational_needs()
- dynamic_retention = γ_retention_base * adaptation_function(information_importance, memory_capacity, context_priority)
- retention_duration = calculate_persistence_time(dynamic_retention)
- storage_priority = determine_memory_priority(dynamic_retention)
```

### Control Parameters
- **Importance Weighting:** How much importance affects retention
- **Capacity Sensitivity:** Responsiveness to memory pressure
- **Retention Range:** Min/max bounds for γ_retention variation

## Design rationale

This modulator follows dual-register governance ensuring memory retention remains intelligible both as technical storage management and as humane memory depth without reducing one to the other.
