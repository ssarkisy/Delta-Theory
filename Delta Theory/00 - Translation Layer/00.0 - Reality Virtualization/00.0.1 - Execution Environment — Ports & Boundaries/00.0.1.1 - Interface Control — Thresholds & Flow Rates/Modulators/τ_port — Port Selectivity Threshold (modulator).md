# τ_port — Port Selectivity Threshold (modulator)

> **τ_port** modulates the **selectivity threshold** of Port interface operations — dynamically adjusting how discriminating ports are in flow admission decisions.

---

## Definition

τ_port is not a fixed filter but a **dynamic selectivity modulator** that adjusts port discrimination based on context. It enables ports to adapt their admission criteria while maintaining flow coherence and interface stability.

---

## Derivation from Core Modulators

**From Core Modulators:** τ_port specializes the core modulators for port-specific selectivity control
- **From λV (Void Resonance Threshold):** τ_port acts as a domain-specific extension of λV, applying void resonance principles to port selectivity
- **Composition relationship:** $τ_{port} = f(λV, \text{port context}, \text{selectivity requirements})$

**From Domain Specialization:** Port-specific selectivity needs that require specialized modulation
- **Interface Requirements:** Ports need selectivity control that operates at different scales than general void resonance
- **Flow Discrimination:** Requires specialized threshold modulation for evaluating incoming difference patterns
- **Admission Control:** Needs context-sensitive selectivity that adapts to flow characteristics

**From Operational Requirements:** Port primitive operations that generate this modulation need
- **Port → I1 Implementation:** Selective Permeability axiom requires dynamic threshold control for admission decisions
- **Port → Discrimination:** Port operations need variable selectivity to handle different types of incoming flows
- **Port → Context Adaptation:** Ports must adjust selectivity based on current system state and environmental conditions

## Mathematical Relationship

$$
τ_{port}(t) = τ_0 \cdot \left(1 + β \cdot \sum_{j} v_j \cdot F_j(t)\right)
$$

Where:
- $τ_0$ = base selectivity threshold
- $β$ = selectivity adaptation strength
- $v_j$ = weight for flow characteristic j
- $F_j(t)$ = normalized flow quality measure at time t

## Modulation Effects

### Primary Function
- **High τ_port:** More selective (stricter admission criteria)
- **Low τ_port:** Less selective (relaxed admission criteria)
- Enables adaptive flow discrimination based on conditions

### Interaction with λV
- λV sets overall interface sensitivity
- τ_port provides flow-specific selectivity adjustment
- $selectivity_{effective} = λV \cdot τ_{port}$

### Flow Quality Adaptation
- High-quality flows: τ_port may decrease (easier admission)
- Low-quality flows: τ_port may increase (stricter filtering)
- Load conditions: τ_port adapts to maintain optimal throughput

## Control Scenarios

### Load-Based Adaptation
- **High Load:** τ_port increases (more selective to manage capacity)
- **Low Load:** τ_port decreases (less selective to maximize utilization)
- **Overload Protection:** τ_port rapidly increases to prevent system stress

### Quality-Based Tuning
- **High-Quality Flows:** τ_port decreases (encourage good content)
- **Low-Quality Flows:** τ_port increases (filter out poor content)
- **Learning Adaptation:** τ_port evolves based on outcome feedback

### Context-Sensitive Operation
- **Trusted Sources:** τ_port decreases (easier admission)
- **Unknown Sources:** τ_port increases (cautious admission)
- **Emergency Conditions:** τ_port may override for critical flows

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Port Selectivity Control:
- base_selectivity = τ_port_base
- flow_quality = assess_flow_characteristics(incoming_flow)
- context_factors = evaluate_port_conditions()
- dynamic_selectivity = τ_port_base * adaptation_function(flow_quality, context_factors)
- admission_threshold = λV * dynamic_selectivity
- admit_flow = (flow_score >= admission_threshold)
```

### Control Parameters
- **Adaptation Sensitivity:** How quickly τ_port responds to changes
- **Selectivity Range:** Min/max bounds for τ_port variation
- **Quality Weights:** Importance of different flow characteristics

## Design rationale

This modulator follows dual-register governance ensuring port selectivity remains intelligible both as technical filter control and as humane discernment without reducing one to the other.
