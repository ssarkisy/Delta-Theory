# 00.0.1 - Execution Environment — Ports & Boundaries (index)

> Manages how difference crosses boundaries through ports, gates, and surfaces.

---

## Module Overview

The Execution Environment module defines how structure interacts with its environment:

- **Interface Control:** Ports and gates that manage ingress/egress flows
- **Boundary Management:** Surfaces that control transparency and isolation
- **Threshold Control:** λV-modulated receptivity and protection mechanisms
- **State Management:** Memory buffers that maintain continuity

These elements work together to enable safe and controlled interaction between structure and environment while maintaining both technical precision and humane understanding.

## λV Modulation Examples

The Void Resonance Threshold (λV) controls interface receptivity and protection:

### Port Control
- **High λV:** Port becomes highly selective, only allowing closely matched flows
  - Technical: Strict validation, low acceptance rate
  - Humane: Cautious openness, selective trust
- **Low λV:** Port becomes more permeable, accepting broader range of inputs
  - Technical: Relaxed validation, higher throughput
  - Humane: Open receptivity, welcoming stance

### Gate Thresholds
- **λV modulation** adjusts trigger sensitivity:
  - `λV↑`: Higher activation threshold (more stability, less responsiveness)
  - `λV↓`: Lower activation threshold (more responsiveness, less stability)

### Surface Exposure
- **λV calibration** controls boundary transparency:
  - Technical: ACL strictness, firewall rules
  - Humane: Privacy levels, intimacy boundaries

### State Buffer Management
- **λV influence** on memory retention:
  - High λV: Selective retention, quality focus
  - Low λV: Broad retention, quantity focus
