# 00.0.1 - Execution Environment — Ports & Boundaries (index)

> Manages how difference crosses boundaries through ports, gates, and surfaces.

---

## Module Overview

The Execution Environment module defines how structure interacts with its environment:

- **Interface Control:** Ports and gates that manage ingress/egress flows
- **Boundary Management:** Surfaces that control transparency and isolation
- **Threshold Control:** λV-modulated receptivity and protection mechanisms
- **State Management:** Memory buffers that maintain continuity

These elements work together to enable safe and controlled interaction between structure and environment while maintaining both technical precision and humane understanding.
