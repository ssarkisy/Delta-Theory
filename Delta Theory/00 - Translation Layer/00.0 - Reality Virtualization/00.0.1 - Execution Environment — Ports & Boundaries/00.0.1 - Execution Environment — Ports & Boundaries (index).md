# 00.0.1 - Execution Environment — Ports & Boundaries (meta)

> Interfaces to the outside: how difference crosses boundaries through ports, gates, and surfaces.
> Manages ingress/egress, thresholds, receptivity, and isolation.

---

## Scope

The execution environment defines how structure interacts with its environment:

1. Ports and interfaces (ingress/egress points)
2. Boundary conditions (transparency/opacity)
3. Receptivity thresholds (ignition/collapse)
4. Isolation surfaces (protection/exposure)

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the environment into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Environment concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Port | Protocol endpoint | `Port`, `Socket` |
| Gate | Rate limiter | `RateLimit`, `Breaker` |
| Surface | Exposure policy | `Policy`, `ACL` |
| Memory | State retention | `Cache`, `Buffer` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Environment concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Port | Opening/boundary | Where we meet |
| Gate | Readiness/consent | "Not now" |
| Surface | Selective sharing | What we show |
| Memory | Living history | What we keep |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Interface | Boundary | Where difference crosses |
| Rate limit | Tolerance | Safe flow bound |
| Policy | Readiness | What can enter |
| Buffer | History | What persists |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Field interface | Natural boundary |
| Chemistry | Reaction surface | Chemical contact |
| Biology | Cell membrane | Living boundary |
| Social | Group interface | Trust boundary |
| Economy | Market access | Value gateway |
| Politics | Legal boundary | Power surface |
| Networks | Protocol port | System edge |
| Cognition | Attention filter | Mind's door |

## Core Operations

The environment provides four key operations:

1. **Ingress Control**
   - Technical: Rate limiting, validation
   - Humane: Selective acceptance, consent

2. **Egress Shaping**
   - Technical: Backpressure, throttling
   - Humane: Measured sharing, boundaries

3. **Surface Management**
   - Technical: Exposure policy, ACLs
   - Humane: Trust boundaries, privacy

4. **State Retention**
   - Technical: Caching, buffering
   - Humane: Memory, continuity

---

## Stability Conditions

Key invariants that must be maintained:

| Condition | Technical aspect | Humane aspect |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| Safe flow | Rate ≤ capacity | Within tolerance |
| Coherence | State consistency | Memory integrity |
| Protection | Access control | Trust boundary |
| Recovery | Circuit breaker | Rest/cooldown |

---

## Modulator Influence

Environment is primarily shaped by λV (Void resonance):

| Aspect | λV influence |
|--------|-------------|
| Threshold | Sets ignition/absorption point |
| Hysteresis | Controls on/off separation |
| Backpressure | Manages overload protection |
| Sensitivity | Tunes receptivity level |

Secondary influences:
- ∇S: Boundary sharpness/granularity
- ψA: State retention/coherence

---

## Design rationale

The execution environment must be intelligible in both technical and humane registers per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Each aspect maintains its dual nature without reduction to either register.
