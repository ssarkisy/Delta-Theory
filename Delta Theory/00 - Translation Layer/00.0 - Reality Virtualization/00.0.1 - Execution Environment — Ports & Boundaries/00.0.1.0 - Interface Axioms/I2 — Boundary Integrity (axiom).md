# I2 — Boundary Integrity (axiom)

> **Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity** — the interface itself must persist as a recognizable entity through all interactions.

---

## Primitive Derivation

I2 emerges from how structural primitives maintain interface coherence over time:

**From ∆ (Difference):** Interface identity begins with persistent distinction
- $∆_{identity}$ = the difference that makes the interface recognizable
- This distinction must persist across time and interactions

**From R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Interface context must remain coherent
- R($∆_{identity}$) embeds the interface's distinguishing features in stable relations
- Relational context preserves what makes the interface "itself"

**From ⊚ (Stabilization):** Identity coherence requires recursive reinforcement
- $⊚(R(∆_{identity}))$ = self-reinforcing identity maintenance
- Closure ensures the interface recognizes and preserves its own character

**From F (Form):** Interface Form must persist through perturbations
- $F_{interface}$ = stable identity that survives environmental changes
- Form integrity depends on maintaining distinguishing characteristics

## Statement

For any interface I operating over time t, boundary integrity requires:
- $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{identity}))$ where ∆_identity makes the interface recognizable
- $R(∆_{identity})$ embeds distinguishing features in stable relational context
- $⊚$ ensures recursive identity reinforcement across time
- The resulting Form maintains recognizable boundary coherence

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Identity maintenance | State consistency | `StateManager`, `IdentityStore` |
| Boundary coherence | Interface definition | `APIContract`, `ServiceInterface` |
| Persistent character | Configuration stability | `ConfigManager`, `ProfileStore` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct | Example |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Identity maintenance | Self-recognition | "I know who I am" |
| Boundary coherence | Personal boundaries | "This is where I begin and end" |
| Persistent character | Core identity | "I remain myself through change" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| State consistency | Self-recognition | What stays the same |
| Interface definition | Personal boundary | Where self meets other |
| Configuration stability | Core identity | What makes you you |

## Stability Requirements

- **Identity Continuity:** Interface remains recognizable over time
- **Boundary Clarity:** Interface-environment distinction persists
- **Character Preservation:** Essential interface properties remain stable
- **Coherence Maintenance:** Internal consistency preserved through interactions

---

## Modulator Effects

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- **Primary control** for boundary definition and identity clarity
- High ∇S: Sharp, clear boundaries with strong identity
- Low ∇S: Soft, permeable boundaries with fluid identity

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Affects boundary sensitivity to external perturbations
- High λV: More resistant to identity disruption
- Low λV: More adaptable but potentially less stable

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Manages temporal identity coherence
- Ensures identity persistence across phase transitions

---

## Violation Conditions

- **Identity Drift:** Interface character changes beyond recognition
- **Boundary Dissolution:** Interface becomes indistinguishable from environment
- **Character Fragmentation:** Essential properties become inconsistent
- **Coherence Loss:** Internal structure breaks down

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Dependent on: Core axioms A1-A3 (derives from their application to interfaces)
- Independent of: Other interface axioms I1, I3 (foundational peer)
- Applies to: All interface primitives requiring persistent identity
- Domain scope: All interface operations requiring boundary stability

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Enables Surface boundary definition and maintenance
- Enables Buffer identity preservation across time
- Enables Gate state coherence during transitions
- Enables Port identity consistency through flow variations
- Forms foundation for boundary control modulators (β_boundary, ∇S)

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Identity Interface:
- maintain_identity() → identity_state
- verify_boundary() → boundary_integrity
- preserve_character() → character_consistency
- monitor_coherence() → coherence_level
```

### Error Recovery
- **Identity Restoration:** Return to known stable identity state
- **Boundary Reinforcement:** Strengthen interface definition
- **Character Repair:** Restore essential properties
- **Coherence Recovery:** Re-establish internal consistency

## Design rationale
