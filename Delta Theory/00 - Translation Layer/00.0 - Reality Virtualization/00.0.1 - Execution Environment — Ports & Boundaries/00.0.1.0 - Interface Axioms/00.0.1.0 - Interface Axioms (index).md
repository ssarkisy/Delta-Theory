# 00.0.1.0 - Interface Axioms (index)

> Foundational truths governing how structure interacts with fields through boundaries, ports, and surfaces.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the fundamental axioms that govern interface behavior:

- **I1 — Selective Permeability:** Interfaces must discriminate between flows
- **I2 — Boundary Integrity:** Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity
- **I3 — Flow Conservation:** Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries

These axioms ensure that field interaction maintains structural stability while enabling controlled exchange with the environment.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Interface Axioms | Foundational truths | [[I1 — Selective Permeability (axiom)]], [[I2 — Boundary Integrity (axiom)]], [[I3 — Flow Conservation (axiom)]] |
| Axiom Mapping | Primitive grounding | All axioms apply to all primitives with different emphasis |
| Stability Conditions | Required invariants | Discrimination, Coherence, Conservation |
| Control Relations | Modulator effects | λV (primary), ∇S (boundary), ψA (coherence) |

Each axiom provides:
- Technical and humane interpretations
- Interface primitive mapping
- Domain manifestations
- Stability requirements
