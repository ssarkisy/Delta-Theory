# I3 — Flow Conservation (axiom)

> **Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries** — what enters, exits, or transforms must maintain ontological coherence.

---

## Primitive Derivation

I3 emerges from how structural primitives enforce difference conservation in interfaces:

**From ∆ (Difference):** Interface operation begins with difference detection and tracking
- $∆_{flow}$ = differences crossing the interface boundary
- All differences must be accounted for - none created or destroyed arbitrarily

**From R(·) (Relational Embedding):** Flow context determines transformation rules  
- $R(∆_{flow})$ embeds each flow difference in transformation-preserving relations
- Relational context ensures transforms maintain ontological coherence

**From ⊚ (Stabilization):** Conservation requires closed accounting loops
- $⊚(R(∆_{flow}))$ = stable conservation tracking that closes coherently
- Closure forces: input tracking = output tracking + state change tracking

**From F (Form):** Interface Form requires conservation to maintain stability
- $F_{interface}$ = conserving boundary that maintains flow accountability
- Form stability depends on reliable difference conservation

## Statement

For any interface I with flows $F_{in}$ and $F_{out}$, conservation requires:
- $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{flow}))$ where $∆_{flow}$ tracks all boundary-crossing differences
- $R(∆_{flow})$ embeds flows in transformation-preserving relational context
- $⊚$ ensures conservation closure: $C(F_{in}) = C(F_{out}) + C(∆State) + C(Transform)$
- The resulting Form maintains accountable difference conservation

## Conservation Types

### Flow Conservation
- **Rate Conservation:** $Rate_{input} = Rate_{output} + Rate_{accumulation}$
- **Volume Conservation:** Total flow volume preserved across transformations
- **Quality Conservation:** Flow characteristics maintained through interface

### State Conservation
- **Identity Conservation:** Essential state properties preserved
- **Information Conservation:** State information neither lost nor created
- **Coherence Conservation:** State integrity maintained across operations

### Transform Conservation
- **Operation Conservation:** All transformations are accountable
- **Energy Conservation:** Transform energy is tracked and balanced
- **Reversibility Conservation:** Transforms maintain inverse operations where possible

---

## Stability Requirements

- **Flow Accountability:** All flows can be tracked and accounted for
- **State Integrity:** Interface state changes are coherent and logged
- **Transform Transparency:** All transformations are observable and auditable
- **Conservation Verification:** Conservation can be validated at any time

---

## Modulator Effects

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- **Primary control** for conservation tracking and temporal coherence
- High ψA: Precise conservation accounting, detailed flow tracking
- Low ψA: Approximate conservation, aggregate flow management

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Affects conservation sensitivity and threshold precision
- High λV: Strict conservation requirements
- Low λV: Relaxed conservation tolerances

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- Controls conservation boundary definition and measurement precision

---

## Violation Conditions

- **Flow Leakage:** Unaccounted flow loss or creation
- **State Corruption:** Interface state becomes inconsistent
- **Transform Loss:** Operations occur without proper accounting
- **Conservation Breakdown:** Total system conservation fails

---

## Recovery Protocols

1. **Flow Audit:** Identify and account for missing or extra flows
2. **State Restoration:** Return interface to known conserved state
3. **Transform Reconciliation:** Account for all performed operations
4. **Conservation Re-establishment:** Restore conservation invariants

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Dependent on: Core axioms A1-A3 (derives from their application to interfaces)
- Requires: I1 (conservation needs flow discrimination) and I2 (conservation needs stable boundaries)
- Applies to: All interface operations involving flow transformation or state change
- Domain scope: All interface operations requiring accountability and coherence

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Enables Gate activation conservation and energy tracking
- Enables Buffer state retention and memory conservation
- Enables Port flow rate conservation and throughput tracking
- Enables Surface exposure conservation and boundary accounting
- Forms foundation for conservation modulators (ψA, γ_retention, δ_sync)

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Conservation Interface:
- track_flow(ingress, egress) → conservation_status
- verify_state() → state_integrity
- audit_transforms() → transform_accounting
- validate_conservation() → conservation_check
```

### Monitoring Requirements
- **Real-time Tracking:** Continuous flow and state monitoring
- **Periodic Auditing:** Regular conservation verification
- **Exception Handling:** Immediate response to conservation violations
- **Recovery Procedures:** Systematic restoration of conservation
