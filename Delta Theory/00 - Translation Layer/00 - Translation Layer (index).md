# 00 - Translation Layer (index)

> Bridges abstract theory and concrete implementation through dual-register operational definitions.

---

## Module Overview

The Translation Layer serves as the foundational bridge between abstract Delta Theory and concrete implementations:

- **Core Translation:** Expresses ontological primitives through accessible metaphors
- **Interface Design:** Provides minimal, stable functional interfaces
- **Domain Bridges:** Enables precise mappings to specific domains
- **Dual-Register:** Maintains both technical and humane understanding

This layer is critical for ensuring the theory remains both implementable and ethically grounded. See [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../PRINCIPLES.md) for dual-register requirements and [ROADMAP.md](../../../../ROADMAP.md) for development path.

## Key Principles

1. **Kernel-First Development**
   - Stabilize ∆, R(·), ⊚ as minimal [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface)
   - SVA modulators as control parameters
   - Clear operational semantics
   - Verifiable behavior

2. **Interface Design**
   - Clear contracts over formal proofs
   - Examples before formalization
   - Progressive stabilization
   - Status tracking

3. **Bridge Construction**
   - Preserve structural fidelity
   - Avoid naive equivalence
   - Domain-specific adaptation
   - Bridge validation
