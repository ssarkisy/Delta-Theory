# 00.2.2 - Coherence Primitives (index)

> Core coherence operations derived from structural primitives: Memory (information preservation), Phase (temporal synchronization), Recovery (stability restoration).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental coherence primitives that enable coherence orchestration operations, derived from the full structural primitive sequence (∆ → R(·) → ⊚) applied to coherence contexts:

- **Memory:** Information preservation primitive for maintaining data across state transitions
- **Phase:** Temporal synchronization primitive for coordinating timing across operations
- **Recovery:** Stability restoration primitive for managing perturbation responses

These primitives work together as the core coherence operations that implement temporal identity, memory preservation, and recovery coordination. They operate in canonical sequence: Memory (preserve) → Phase (synchronize) → Recovery (restore).

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Coherence Primitives | Core operations | [[Memory (primitive)]], [[Phase (primitive)]], [[Recovery (primitive)]] |
| Primitive Derivation | Structural grounding | ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ applied to information/temporal/stability contexts |
| Theorem Mapping | Grounding principles | T7 → Memory, T6 → Phase, T8 → Recovery |
| Operational Flow | Coherence sequence | Memory (preserve) → Phase (synchronize) → Recovery (restore) |
| Control Parameters | Timing constants | γ_retention, r_memory, r_temporal, r_stability, δ_recovery |
| Modulator Effects | Enhancement control | ∇S (structure), λV (threshold), ψA (coherence) |

Each primitive provides technical and humane mappings, operational semantics, control interfaces, and domain manifestations.

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Derivation**
   - All coherence primitives derive from structural primitives (∆, R(·), ⊚)
   - Applied to coherence contexts: information/temporal/stability
   - Each primitive implements the full structural sequence in its domain

2. **Theorem Grounding**
   - Memory implements T7 (Memory Coherence) principles
   - Phase implements T6 (Temporal Continuity) principles
   - Recovery implements T8 (Recovery Stability) principles

3. **Coherence Orchestration**
   - Primitives work together in canonical sequence: Memory → Phase → Recovery
   - Coherence complexity emerges from structural simplicity through specialized application
   - No coherence operation can violate microkernel boundaries (ε, c, Cs)
