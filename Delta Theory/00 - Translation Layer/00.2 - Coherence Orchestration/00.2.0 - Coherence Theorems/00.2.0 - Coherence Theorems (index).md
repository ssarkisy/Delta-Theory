# 00.2.0 - Coherence Theorems (index)

> Derived theorems governing how systems maintain coherence through temporal, state, and stability dimensions — proven consequences of interface theorems extended to coherence orchestration.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the fundamental theorems that govern coherence orchestration, derived from the interface theorems and extended to temporal, state, and stability dimensions:

- **T6 — Temporal Continuity:** Interface identity must persist coherently through time
- **T7 — Memory Coherence:** Information must be preserved across state transitions
- **T8 — Recovery Stability:** Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability

These theorems ensure that system coherence is maintained across temporal, state, and stability boundaries beyond interface operational capacity. They follow the dimensional extension pattern from interface theorems, providing the theoretical foundation for coherence orchestration operations.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| [[T6 — Temporal Continuity (theorem)]] | Identity persistence through time | Temporal identity maintenance, coherence windows |
| [[T7 — Memory Coherence (theorem)]] | Information preservation across states | State transition coherence, memory conservation |
| [[T8 — Recovery Stability (theorem)]] | Stability discrimination for recovery | Perturbation discrimination, recovery coordination |

Each entry provides:
- Formal derivation from interface theorems
- Technical and humane interpretations
- Coherence orchestration mapping
- Domain manifestations and applications

## Key Principles

1. **Dimensional Extension**
   - Extend interface theorems (T3, T4, T5) to coherence orchestration contexts
   - Apply dimensional extension pattern: spatial → temporal/state/stability
   - All coherence theorems must derive from interface theorems

2. **Coherence Orchestration**
   - Complete set for coherence orchestration (T6, T7, T8)
   - Coordinate coherence operations through polarity-based flow (T6 → T7 → T8)
   - Primary modulator ψA (Awareness) controls all coherence timing

3. **Theoretical Consistency**
   - Dimensional extensions must maintain theoretical consistency
   - Coherence operations cannot violate interface or microkernel constraints
   - Polarity-based coordination maintains SVA triad structure
