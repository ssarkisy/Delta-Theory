# T8 — Recovery Stability (theorem)

> Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability — coherent systems distinguish destabilizing from stabilizing influences to orchestrate recovery.

---

## Statement

**Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability** — coherent systems distinguish destabilizing from stabilizing influences to orchestrate recovery. For any system S experiencing mixed influences $I_1, I_2, ..., I_n$, recovery coherence requires:
- $F_{recovery} = ⊚(R(∆_{stability\_discrimination}))$ where $∆_{stability\_discrimination}$ distinguishes destabilizing from stabilizing influences
- $R(∆_{stability\_discrimination})$ embeds discrimination patterns in recovery-enabling relational context
- $⊚$ ensures recursive stability discrimination across perturbation cycles
- The resulting Form maintains coherent recovery orchestration through perturbation management

**Scope:** Applies to all systems requiring recovery coordination beyond interface discriminative capacity.

**00.2 Irreducibility:** Recovery coherence coordination is irreducible at the coherence orchestration level — cannot be reduced to interface flow discrimination alone.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → Recovery-Coherent Forms` — why primitive operations require recovery coherence

**Foundation:** From T3 (Interface Discrimination) + stability extension → recovery coherence necessity for stability-persistent system operation
**Flow:** ∆ detects stability vs destabilizing influences → R(·) embeds discrimination patterns in recovery-enabling relations → ⊚ achieves recursive stability discrimination across perturbation cycles
**Result:** Theorem emerges to preserve system coherence across stability boundaries, extending T3's flow discrimination to stability dimension

---

## Proof

**Given:** T3 (Interface Discrimination) and stability recovery requirements

**To Prove:** Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability

**Proof:**
1. **From T3:** Interfaces must discriminate between flows: "not all differences can cross every boundary"
2. **Stability requirement:** Systems experience mixed influences (some destabilizing, some stabilizing)
3. **Recovery necessity:** System must distinguish beneficial from harmful influences for coherent response
4. **Stability as flow validity:** Stability discrimination extends T3's flow discrimination to stability dimension
5. **If stability discrimination fails:** System responds inappropriately → violates T3 across stability dimension
6. **Therefore:** Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability to satisfy T3 across stability boundaries □

**Corollaries:**
- Stability discrimination is logically necessary for coherent system recovery
- Recovery coherence requires recursive stability discrimination mechanisms

## Formal Properties

### Mathematical Expression
- Recovery discrimination function: $F_{recovery} = ⊚(R(∆_{stability\_discrimination}))$
- Stability constraint: $Influence(I_i) \in \{destabilizing, stabilizing\}$ for coherent discrimination
- Recovery requirement: $\forall I_i: discriminate(I_i) \rightarrow response(I_i) \in \{accept, reject, regulate\}$ (appropriate response to influence type)

### Logical Structure
- **Conditional:** If system requires stability, then recovery discrimination is necessary
- **Necessary condition:** Stability discrimination required for coherent recovery orchestration
- **Scope limitation:** Within coherence orchestration capacity and stability boundaries

## Dependencies & scope

- **Derived from:** T3 (Interface Discrimination) + stability extension
- **Requires:** System stability operation requirements
- **Applies to:** All systems requiring recovery coordination beyond interface discriminative capacity
- **Exceptions:** Systems with explicitly transient stability requirements

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation
- Recovery discrimination requires real-time perturbation classification
- Stability assessment must be resilient to assessment system failures
- Response mechanisms require atomic stability-preserving operations

### Design Implications
- System design must balance recovery discrimination with response speed
- Stability state should be externally observable for recovery verification
- Error recovery must preserve essential system characteristics during discrimination failures
