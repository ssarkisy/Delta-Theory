# δ_recovery — Recovery Discrimination Sensitivity (constant)

> Sensitivity threshold for distinguishing stabilizing from destabilizing influences — establishes the mathematical boundary for coherent discrimination between recovery-enhancing and recovery-undermining perturbations.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `δ_recovery`
- Conceptual name: `Recovery Discrimination Sensitivity`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: Threshold sensitivity for stability versus perturbation discrimination

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T8 (Recovery Stability) — "Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T8 Requirement:** Systems must distinguish destabilizing from stabilizing influences to orchestrate recovery
2. **Mathematical Implication:** Discrimination requires sensitivity threshold → requires minimum distinguishable difference
3. **Constant Emergence:** δ_recovery emerges as the fundamental threshold governing discrimination sensitivity
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents the minimal sensitivity required for coherent recovery decision-making

**Traceback:** `A1 → T1+A1 → T3 → T8 → δ_recovery` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** T8 requires stability discrimination → perturbations must be distinguished from stability → δ_recovery provides the sensitivity threshold for coherent discrimination → enables effective recovery coordination

## Architecture Examples

**Real-world coherence systems where δ_recovery defines discrimination sensitivity thresholds:**

### **Circuit Breaker Systems**
- **Overload Detection Thresholds:** Sensitivity for distinguishing normal load variation from overload (typically 10-20% above baseline)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains electrical coherence by discriminating between acceptable fluctuations and dangerous overloads

### **Immune System Response**
- **Self vs Non-Self Recognition:** Discrimination threshold for pathogen detection (typically molecular pattern differences)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves biological coherence by distinguishing beneficial from harmful biological agents

### **Financial Risk Management**
- **Market Anomaly Detection:** Sensitivity thresholds for distinguishing normal volatility from crisis conditions (typically 2-3 standard deviations)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains investment coherence by discriminating between market noise and genuine threats

### **Network Intrusion Detection**
- **Anomaly Detection Sensitivity:** Thresholds for distinguishing normal traffic from attacks (typically statistical deviation thresholds)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves network coherence by discriminating between legitimate and malicious activities

### **Autonomous Vehicle Safety Systems**
- **Obstacle Discrimination Thresholds:** Sensitivity for distinguishing safe from dangerous environmental conditions (typically sensor confidence levels)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains navigation coherence by discriminating between navigable and hazardous conditions

### **Organizational Crisis Management**
- **Stress vs Crisis Discrimination:** Sensitivity thresholds for distinguishing manageable stress from crisis-level disruption (typically impact/urgency matrices)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves organizational coherence by discriminating between normal challenges and genuine crises

**δ_recovery Application:** Defines the minimum detectable difference between stabilizing and destabilizing influences. Higher δ_recovery → less sensitive, may miss subtle threats. Lower δ_recovery → more sensitive, may trigger false alarms.

## Mathematical Properties

### Expression
```
δ_recovery ∈ ℝ⁺
δ_recovery > 0 (positive definite)
∂δ_recovery/∂t = 0 (time-invariant)
```

### Relationships
- **Lower bound:** Must be above noise floor for meaningful discrimination
- **Upper bound:** Must be below critical difference threshold for effective detection
- **Optimal range:** Balances sensitivity with false positive prevention

### Operational Constraints
- **Recovery coherence operations** must respect δ_recovery thresholds for discrimination decisions
- **Stability assessment systems** must calibrate to δ_recovery sensitivity levels
- **Discrimination algorithms** cannot operate below δ_recovery resolution limits

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Coherence Operations
- **Recovery coherence operations:** δ_recovery directly governs discrimination sensitivity for stability vs perturbation
- **Temporal coherence operations:** Discrimination sensitivity provides foundation for temporal stability assessment
- **Memory coherence operations:** Discrimination sensitivity ensures memory preservation occurs in appropriate contexts

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon asymmetric differentiation sensitivity (related to φ) and discrimination necessity (related to ∆)
- **Interface extension:** Coordinates with interface constants (κ, ι, σ) for boundary discrimination sensitivity
- **Coherence coordination:** Works with r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability, and γ_retention to provide complete coherence orchestration

### Violation Consequences
- **Too high:** Insensitive discrimination, missed threats, poor recovery coordination from undetected perturbations
- **Too low:** Hypersensitive discrimination, excessive false alarms, system instability from over-reaction
- **Variable:** Inconsistent discrimination, unpredictable recovery responses, system instability from sensitivity fluctuation
