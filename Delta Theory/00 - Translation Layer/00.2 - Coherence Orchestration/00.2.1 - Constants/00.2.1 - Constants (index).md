# 00.2.1 - Constants (index)

> Mathematical invariants governing coherence orchestration rates and tolerances — derived from coherence theorems T6, T7, T8 to establish operational parameters for temporal, memory, and recovery coordination.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the mathematical constants that govern coherence orchestration, derived from the coherence theorems T6, T7, T8. These constants provide operational parameters for temporal coherence, memory coherence, and recovery coherence coordination.

The coherence constants include:
- **Temporal Constants:** Parameters governing temporal identity persistence and coherence timing
- **Memory Constants:** Parameters governing information retention and state transition coherence
- **Recovery Constants:** Parameters governing stability discrimination and recovery coordination

These constants enable coherence orchestration operations by providing mathematical foundations for rates, tolerances, and thresholds that maintain system coherence across temporal, state, and stability boundaries.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Temporal Constants | T6-derived temporal parameters | r_temporal (coherence maintenance rate) |
| Memory Constants | T7-derived memory parameters | r_memory (maintenance rate), γ_retention (retention factor) |
| Recovery Constants | T8-derived recovery parameters | r_stability (assessment rate), δ_recovery (discrimination sensitivity) |

Each entry provides:
- Direct derivation from coherence theorems
- Mathematical relationships and operational parameters
- Coherence orchestration timing and tolerance specifications
- Domain manifestations across technical and humane registers

## Key Principles

1. **Direct Theorem Derivation**
   - All coherence constants must derive from coherence theorems (T6, T7, T8)
   - T6 (Temporal) → r_temporal (maintenance rate)
   - T7 (Memory) → r_memory, γ_retention (maintenance rate, retention factor)
   - T8 (Recovery) → r_stability, δ_recovery (assessment rate, discrimination sensitivity)

2. **Mathematical Foundations**
   - Constants provide mathematical foundations for coherence modulators and primitives
   - Constants serve as bridges between theorem-level principles and implementation operations
   - Constants must maintain consistency with microkernel and interface mathematical foundations

3. **Coherence Orchestration**
   - Operational parameters enable coherence coordination across temporal, state, and stability dimensions
   - Constants provide stability guarantees for coherence operations
   - Mathematical anchors constrain coherence orchestration parameters within viable bounds
