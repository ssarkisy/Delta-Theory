# r_memory — Memory Coherence Maintenance Rate (constant)

> Base rate of memory coherence maintenance operations — defines the fundamental frequency at which information patterns must be reinforced to maintain coherence across state transitions.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `r_memory`
- Conceptual name: `Memory Coherence Maintenance Rate`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: Base operational rate for memory coherence preservation activities

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T9 (Memory Coherence) — "Information must be preserved across state transitions"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T9 Requirement:** Information patterns must maintain coherent accessibility through system state changes
2. **Mathematical Implication:** Information coherence degrades without active maintenance → requires periodic reinforcement
3. **Constant Emergence:** r_memory emerges as the fundamental rate governing memory maintenance operations
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents the minimal operational tempo required for sustainable memory coherence

**Traceback:** `A0 → T3+A0 → T4 → T9 → r_memory` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** T9 requires information preservation across states → information coherence degrades without maintenance → r_memory provides the base rate for reinforcement operations → enables sustainable memory coherence

## Formal identity

$$r_{memory} = \frac{1}{\tau_{memory}}$$

where $\tau_{memory}$ is the characteristic time scale for memory coherence maintenance operations.

## Anchor role

- **Memory operational tempo:** Sets the fundamental rate for information coherence maintenance
- **Cognitive resource allocation:** Defines investment in memory preservation activities
- **Information coordination:** Provides shared timing reference for distributed memory operations

## Scope & invariance

- **Domain:** All memory coherence operations requiring active maintenance
- **Invariance:** Holds across domains implementing T9 (Memory Coherence)
- **Precision:** Domain instances determine specific frequencies and maintenance intervals
- **Scaling:** Rate may scale with information complexity and coherence requirements

## Architecture Examples

**Real-world coherence systems where r_memory defines memory maintenance frequency:**

### **Database Systems**
- **Transaction Log Maintenance:** Regular checkpoint operations to maintain transaction coherence (typically every 1-5 minutes)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves transaction state coherence across system restarts and failures

### **Distributed Cache Systems**
- **Cache Coherence Protocols:** Memory synchronization frequency in distributed systems (typically 100ms-1s intervals)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains data consistency across distributed memory nodes

### **Neural Network Training**
- **Memory Consolidation Cycles:** Gradient update frequency for maintaining learned pattern coherence (typically per batch/epoch)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves learned information patterns across training iterations

**r_memory Application:** Defines the maximum safe interval between memory coherence maintenance operations. Waiting longer than r_memory → information degradation and coherence loss. Maintaining faster → unnecessary overhead but preserved coherence.

## Mathematical Properties

### Expression
```
r_memory ∈ ℝ⁺
r_memory > 0 (positive definite)
∂r_memory/∂t = 0 (time-invariant)
```

### Relationships
- **Lower bound:** Must allow memory maintenance completion
- **Upper bound:** Must prevent information coherence degradation
- **Stability:** Constant across memory coherence contexts

### Operational Constraints
- **Coherence operations** must respect r_memory timing for memory operations
- **Temporal/Memory/Recovery operations** must maintain information coherence within r_memory bounds
- **Modulator effects** cannot violate r_memory requirements

---

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Coherence Operations
- **Temporal coherence operations:** Memory provides historical context for temporal identity maintenance
- **Memory coherence operations:** r_memory directly governs information preservation timing across state transitions
- **Recovery coherence operations:** Memory coherence enables recovery by preserving system state information

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon closure geometry timing (related to π) and recursive growth patterns (related to e)
- **Interface extension:** Coordinates with interface constants (κ, ι, σ) for boundary memory operations
- **Coherence coordination:** Works with r_temporal and r_stability to provide complete coherence orchestration timing

### Violation Consequences
- **Too fast:** Unnecessary memory maintenance overhead, resource waste, potential system performance degradation
- **Too slow:** Information coherence degradation, memory inconsistency, state transition failures
- **Variable:** Inconsistent memory coherence, unpredictable information preservation, system instability
