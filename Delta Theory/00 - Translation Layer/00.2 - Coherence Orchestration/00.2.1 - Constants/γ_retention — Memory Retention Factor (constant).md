# γ_retention — Memory Retention Factor (constant)

> Proportional factor determining information retention across state transitions — establishes the mathematical relationship governing how much information persists through system state changes.

## Definition

- Symbol: `γ_retention`
- Conceptual name: `Memory Retention Factor`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: Retention coefficient for information preservation across state boundaries

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T9 (Memory Coherence) — "Systems must preserve information across state transitions"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T9 Requirement:** Systems must maintain information coherence despite state changes and transitions
2. **Mathematical Implication:** Information preservation requires quantifiable retention → requires proportional factor
3. **Constant Emergence:** γ_retention emerges as the fundamental factor governing information preservation efficiency
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents the mathematical relationship determining how much information survives state transitions

**Traceback:** `A0 → T3+A0 → T4 → T9 → γ_retention` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** T9 requires information preservation across states → state transitions threaten information coherence → γ_retention provides the mathematical factor determining preservation efficiency → enables stable memory coherence

## Architecture Examples

**Real-world coherence systems where γ_retention defines information preservation efficiency:**

### **Database Transaction Systems**
- **ACID Compliance Ratios:** Information preservation across transaction commits (typically 99.9%+ retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains data coherence by ensuring information survives state transitions with predictable retention

### **Distributed Cache Systems**
- **Cache Persistence Factors:** Information retention across cache evictions and rebalancing (typically 80-95% retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves application coherence by maintaining predictable information availability across state changes

### **Educational Learning Systems**
- **Knowledge Transfer Efficiency:** Information retention across learning contexts and time (typically 20-80% retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains learning coherence by preserving knowledge through educational transitions

### **Organizational Knowledge Management**
- **Institutional Memory Preservation:** Information retention through leadership transitions (typically 40-70% retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves organizational coherence by maintaining institutional knowledge across personnel changes

### **Biological Memory Formation**
- **Synaptic Consolidation Efficiency:** Information retention from short-term to long-term memory (typically 10-30% retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains cognitive coherence by preserving important information across memory state transitions

### **Version Control Systems**
- **Data Migration Success Rates:** Information preservation across system upgrades and migrations (typically 99%+ retention)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains development coherence by ensuring code history survives system transitions

**γ_retention Application:** Defines the expected proportion of information that survives state transitions. Higher γ_retention → better information preservation but potentially higher overhead. Lower γ_retention → information loss but potentially more efficient transitions.

## Mathematical Properties

### Expression
```
γ_retention ∈ [0, 1]
0 ≤ γ_retention ≤ 1 (bounded ratio)
∂γ_retention/∂t = 0 (time-invariant)
```

### Relationships
- **Lower bound:** 0 (complete information loss)
- **Upper bound:** 1 (perfect information preservation)
- **Typical range:** Domain-dependent, often 0.1-0.99

### Operational Constraints
- **Memory coherence operations** must achieve minimum γ_retention for information preservation
- **State transition systems** must design for target γ_retention values
- **Information systems** cannot exceed γ_retention = 1 (perfect preservation impossible in practice)

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Coherence Operations
- **Memory coherence operations:** γ_retention directly governs information preservation across state transitions
- **Temporal coherence operations:** Memory retention provides foundation for temporal identity persistence
- **Recovery coherence operations:** Memory retention ensures recovery operations have access to preserved information

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon relational embedding efficiency (related to R(·)) and closure preservation (related to ⊚)
- **Interface extension:** Coordinates with interface constants (κ, ι, σ) for boundary information preservation
- **Coherence coordination:** Works with r_temporal, r_memory, and r_stability to provide complete coherence orchestration

### Violation Consequences
- **Too low:** Excessive information loss, memory coherence failures, system knowledge degradation
- **Too high:** Unrealistic preservation expectations, system overhead from attempting perfect retention
- **Variable:** Unpredictable information preservation, inconsistent memory coherence, system instability
