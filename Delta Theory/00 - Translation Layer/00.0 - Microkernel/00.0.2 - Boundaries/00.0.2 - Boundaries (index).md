# 00.0.2 - Boundaries (index)

> Operational limits that define the feasible envelope for stable recursive forms: resolution thresholds, propagation speeds, and capacity constraints.

**Derivation Trace:** ∆ → A1 (Irreducibility) → T1/T2 (Asymmetry/Recursivity) → Boundaries (ε, c, Cs)

---

## Module Overview

Boundaries represent the operational constraints that recursive difference-based systems must respect to maintain stability and coherence. They define the limits within which the microkernel can operate effectively.

Each boundary:
- **Derives from axioms/theorems** as necessary operational constraints
- **Sets hard limits** that cannot be exceeded without system breakdown
- **Enables stable operation** by preventing overflow, underflow, and instability
- **Manifests domain-specifically** while maintaining conceptual consistency

## Content Structure

| Boundary | Derivation | Role | Constraint Type |
|----------|------------|------|-----------------|
| [[ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (boundary)]] | A1 (Irreducibility) | Minimal meaningful difference | Lower bound |
| [[c — Difference Propagation Limit (boundary)]] | T1 (Asymmetry) | Maximum propagation speed | Rate limit |
| [[Cs — Stability Capacity (boundary)]] | T2 (Recursivity) | Maximum difference load | Upper bound |

Each boundary provides operational constraint definition, dual-register mapping, domain manifestations, and formal mathematical relationships.

## Key Principles

1. **Operational Constraint Foundation**
   - Boundaries derive from foundational axioms (A1) and theorems (T1, T2)
   - Define hard operational limits that cannot be exceeded without system breakdown
   - Each boundary addresses a different type of constraint (resolution, speed, capacity)

2. **Complete Operational Envelope**
   - Three boundaries define complete operational envelope: `ε ≤ differences ≤ Cs` with `propagation ≤ c`
   - All microkernel operations must respect boundary constraints
   - Boundaries are hard constraints - violation causes system failure

3. **Domain Implementation Requirements**
   - Domain implementations must map conceptual boundaries to specific values
   - Domain-specific boundary values must maintain conceptual consistency
   - Boundary violations indicate architectural or implementation problems
