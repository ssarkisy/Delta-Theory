# c — Difference Propagation Limit (boundary)

> Maximum speed at which a difference can travel through the relational field.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: c
- Conceptual name: Difference Propagation Limit
- Definition: the limiting propagation speed for signals/differences across Void

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F` — why primitive operations require this boundary

**Flow:** ∆ must exist distinguishably (A0) → directional asymmetry (T2) → meaningful ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) requires causal ordering → causality demands finite propagation speed → c emerges as maximum speed preserving both existence and asymmetric causality
**Foundation:** From A0+T2 (Existential Difference + Asymmetry) → directional differences must exist distinguishably while preserving causal constraint → finite speed limit necessary
**Role:** Enforces maximum difference propagation speed to preserve causal asymmetry and directional coherence

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the boundary into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Boundary concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Speed limit | Channel capacity | `MaxThroughput` |
| Update bound | Refresh rate | `MaxUpdateRate` |
| Latency floor | Minimum delay | `MinLatency` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Boundary concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|-----------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Speed limit | Integration capacity | How fast we can absorb change |
| Update bound | Processing rhythm | Natural pause between thoughts |
| Latency floor | Response time | Quickest possible reaction |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Channel limit | Absorption rate | Maximum flow of difference |
| Update cycle | Process rhythm | Natural pace of change |
| Min delay | Response gap | Irreducible separation |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Light speed | Causal horizon |
| Chemistry | Reaction speed | Process timing |
| Biology | Signal velocity | Response time |
| Social | Information flow | Understanding pace |
| Economy | Transaction speed | Market response |
| Politics | Change rate | Adaptation pace |
| Networks | Bandwidth limit | Processing bound |
| Cognition | Neural delay | Reaction time |

## Formal identity

- Core constraint: propagation_rate ≤ c
- Causal ordering: Δt ≥ Δx/c (space-time interval must respect speed limit)
- Asymmetry preservation: ∆(A→B) and ∆(B→A) maintain distinct causal ordering
- Field coherence: ∇·F propagates at bounded speed to maintain field consistency

---

## Anchor role

- Sets fundamental limit on difference propagation speed
- Establishes causality and update order in systems
- Creates horizons of possible interaction

---

## Scope & invariance

- Universal limit across all domains
- Manifests as specific speed/rate limits in each context
- Setting c = 1 (natural units) is a convenience; doesn't derive the concept

## Interplay with SVA (if relevant)

- ∇S: limits rate of structural differentiation
- λV: bounds field propagation speed
- ψA: constrains phase alignment timing

---

## Critical Implications

**System Design:**
- Latency budgets must respect propagation limits for system coherence
- Distributed systems require careful timing coordination within c bounds
- Real-time systems must account for finite signal travel time
- Causal consistency depends on respecting propagation speed limits

**Failure Modes:**
- Exceeding c: Causality violations, temporal paradoxes, system instability
- Approaching c: Relativistic effects, time dilation, energy requirements increase
- Ignoring c: Race conditions, inconsistent state, logical contradictions

**Prevention Strategies:**
- Design with safety margins well below c
- Implement timeout mechanisms for bounded waiting
- Use asynchronous patterns that respect propagation delays
- Build causal consistency checks into system architecture

## Relationship to Other Boundaries

**With ε (Resolution Quantum):**
- Minimum propagation time: Δt_min = ε/c (smallest meaningful time interval)
- Resolution-speed trade-off: finer resolution requires slower processing
- Combined constraint: meaningful differences must propagate at bounded speed

**With Cs (Stability Capacity):**
- Throughput limit: maximum differences per unit time = Cs/Δt where Δt ≥ ε/c
- Capacity-speed coupling: higher capacity systems may have lower propagation speeds
- Stability requires both bounded load (Cs) and bounded rate (c)

**Optimization Considerations:**
- Three-way trade-off between resolution (ε), capacity (Cs), and speed (c)
- System design must balance all three boundaries for optimal performance
- Violating any boundary can cascade to others (e.g., exceeding c can overflow Cs)
