# T1 — Asymmetry (theorem)

> Order matters: ∆(A,B) ≠ ∆(B,A) in any meaningful embedding.

---

## Statement

- Difference is inherently directional at resolution ε: ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) in any meaningful embedding. The relationship between A and B depends on which is considered the reference point, creating asymmetric propagation patterns within the system's operational boundaries.

## Rationale (context)

- Establishes directionality in difference propagation within operational resolution (ε)
- Enables meaningful distinction between source and target at current system level
- Creates basis for field gradients and propagation limits (c) without making absolute claims
- Maintains operational precision while acknowledging potential deeper symmetries at sub-ε levels

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F` — why primitive operations require this theorem

**Foundation:** From A1 → if ∆(A→B) = ∆(B→A), differences become indistinguishable, violating irreducibility
**Flow:** ∆ has inherent orientation → R(·) preserves directional context → ⊚ maintains directional bias → F exhibits asymmetric patterns
**Result:** Asymmetry theorem emerges to preserve primitive operation coherence

---

## Proof

**Given:** A1 (Irreducibility) — Primitive difference (∆) cannot be decomposed without loss of distinction

**To Prove:** ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) in any meaningful embedding at resolution ε

**Proof:**
1. **Assume for contradiction:** ∆(A→B) = ∆(B→A) for some meaningful embedding
2. **By definition of equality:** If ∆(A→B) = ∆(B→A), then these two differences are indistinguishable
3. **Loss of operational distinction:** The directional information (A→B vs B→A) is lost
4. **Contradiction with A1:** This constitutes a decomposition that loses distinction, violating A1
5. **Resolution constraint:** Since we operate at resolution ε, this distinction must be preserved at our operational level
6. **Therefore:** ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) must hold to preserve irreducibility □

**Corollaries:**
- Directional operators ∆(·→·) preserve orientation information
- Asymmetric propagation patterns emerge naturally from primitive operations
- Field gradients become possible through directional bias

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Derived from: A1 (Irreducibility) — asymmetry is necessary to preserve irreducible distinction
- Applies to: all difference embeddings and propagation paths within operational boundaries

## Formal Properties

### Mathematical Expression
- Core relationship: ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) at resolution ε
- Directional operator: ∆(·→·) preserves orientation
- Asymmetric propagation: enables field gradients ∇

### Logical Structure
- **Necessity**: Irreducibility (A1) → Asymmetry (T1)
- **Conditional**: If differences are distinguishable, then order matters
- **Scope**: Applies within operational boundaries at resolution ε

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation
- Asymmetric data structures must preserve directional information at all operations
- Message routing systems require explicit source-target distinctions to maintain propagation fidelity
- Network topologies must encode edge directionality to prevent information loss

### Design Implications
- Interface design should reflect directional bias in user flows and information architecture
- System state transitions must maintain directional context to preserve operational distinction
- Performance optimizations cannot compress away directional information without violating T1

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Axiom Relationships
- **A1 (Irreducibility)**: T1 emerges necessarily from A1 to preserve directional distinction
- Asymmetry prevents decomposition that would violate irreducibility requirements

### Theorem Interactions
- **T2 (Recursivity)**: Asymmetric patterns stabilize through recursive embedding
- Directional bias enables the closure operations required for stable form generation

## Examples (concept)

- **Network routing**: Packets flow A→B differently than B→A due to network topology and routing tables
- **Social dynamics**: Influence propagation follows asymmetric patterns based on social hierarchies and relationships
- **Economic exchange**: Value transfer A→B creates different market effects than B→A transactions
- **Cognitive attention**: Focus direction A→B generates different neural patterns than reverse attention B→A
