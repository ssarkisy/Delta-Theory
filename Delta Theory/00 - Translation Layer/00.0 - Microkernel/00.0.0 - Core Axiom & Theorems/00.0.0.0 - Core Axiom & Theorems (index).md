# 00.0.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems (index)

> Foundational axiom and derived theorems that ground the kernel primitives and enable difference-based recursion.

---

## Module Overview

The Core Axioms module provides the irreducible foundation of Delta Theory. It defines:
- **One foundational axiom (A1)** that establishes the minimal ontological base
- **Two derived theorems (T1, T2)** that follow necessarily from A1
- Their mapping to the SVA triad (Structure, Void, Awareness)
- The emergence of core constants and boundaries
- Guidelines for domain-specific implementations

This minimal foundation demonstrates remarkable theoretical elegance: all of ∆-Theory emerges from a single irreducible principle.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Foundational Axiom | Single irreducible principle | [[A1 — Irreducibility (axiom)]] |
| Derived Theorems | Necessary consequences of A1 | [[T1 — Asymmetry (theorem)]], [[T2 — Recursivity (theorem)]] |
| SVA Mapping | Polarity and domain alignment | A1 → P0 (Awareness), T1 → P- (Void), T2 → P+ (Structure) |
| Boundaries | Direct operational limits | ε (resolution), c (propagation), Cs (stability) |
| Constants | Derived mathematical relationships | e (growth), φ (asymmetric ratio), π (closure ratio) |

The axiom and theorems provide:
- **A1 (Axiom):** Foundational irreducibility principle with ε-bounded scope
- **T1 (Theorem):** Derived directionality necessity from A1
- **T2 (Theorem):** Derived recursivity/closure necessity from A1
- Technical and humane mappings for all
- Clear derivation chains showing logical necessity

## Key Principles

1. **Single-Axiom Foundation**
   - A1 is the foundational axiom covering irreducible distinction
   - T1 and T2 are derived consequences, not independent principles
   - Clear derivation chains: A1 → T1, A1 → T2

2. **SVA Triad Alignment**
   - A1 (Irreducibility) → P0 (Awareness): Distinction itself
   - T1 (Asymmetry) → P- (Void): Field directionality
   - T2 (Recursivity) → P+ (Structure): Form-making

3. **Derivation Patterns**
   - ε, e emerge directly from A1 (foundational axiom)
   - φ, c emerge from T1 (derived asymmetry theorem)
   - π emerges from T2 (derived recursivity theorem)
