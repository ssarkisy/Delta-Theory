# 00.0.1 - Constants (index)

> Mathematical invariants that emerge from the core axioms and theorems: fundamental ratios and rates that govern recursive processes.

**Derivation Trace:** ∆ → A0 (Existential Difference) → T1/T2/T3 (Irreducibility/Asymmetry/Recursivity) → Constants (e, φ, π)

## Module Overview

Constants represent the mathematical relationships that emerge necessarily from the foundational axioms and theorems. Unlike boundaries (which set limits) or modulators (which tune behavior), constants express the inherent mathematical structure of recursive difference-based systems.

Each constant:
- **Emerges logically** from A0 + microkernel theorems (T1, T2, T3)
- **Maintains dual-register** mapping (technical ↔ humane)
- **Manifests universally** across domains while allowing domain-specific instantiation
- **Anchors recursive processes** through stable mathematical relationships

## Content Structure

| Constant | Derivation | Role | Mathematical Form |
|----------|------------|------|------------------|
| [[e — Natural Transformation Rate (constant)]] | A0+T1 (Existence+Irreducibility) | Growth/transformation | $e = \lim_{n \to \infty}(1 + \frac{1}{n})^n$ |
| [[φ — Asymmetric Stabilization Ratio (constant)]] | A0+T2 (Existence+Asymmetry) | Optimal asymmetric split | $φ = \frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$ |
| [[π — Closure Geometry Ratio (constant)]] | A0+T3 (Existence+Recursivity) | Circular closure | $π = \frac{C}{d}$ |

**Type:** All microkernel constants are pure mathematical invariants that emerge directly from foundational axioms.

## Key Principles

1. **Logical Emergence**
   - All constants derive necessarily from A0 + microkernel theorems (T1, T2, T3)
   - Mathematical relationships, not arbitrary values
   - Universal patterns across domains

2. **Conceptual Anchoring**
   - Constants represent relationships, not specific numbers
   - Domain instances carry concrete values and precision requirements
   - Enable cross-domain comparison and normalization

3. **Recursive Structure**
   - Self-similar appearance at multiple scales
   - Scale-invariant mathematical relationships
   - Emergent from primitive operations, not externally imposed
