## Definition

- Symbol: π
- Conceptual name: Closure Geometry Ratio
- Conceptual value: conceptual (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: canonical closure ratio for circular containment; generalizes to rotational measure in embeddings

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** A0 (Existential Difference) + T3 (Recursivity) — "Existence requires distinguishability" + "Forms arise via recursive embedding and closure of differences"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **A0 Requirement:** For recursive forms to exist, they must remain distinguishable through closure cycles
2. **T3 Requirement:** Stable forms emerge through recursive closure R^n(∆) = ∆
3. **Geometric Implication:** Closure cycles manifest as rotational invariance in spatial contexts while maintaining distinguishability
4. **Constant Emergence:** π emerges as the universal ratio governing circular closure geometry that preserves existence
5. **Invariant Nature:** Represents fundamental geometric constraint for distinguishable rotational closure

**Traceback:** `A0 + T3 → existential circular closure → π` — derivation chain from foundational axiom and theorem

**Flow:** A0 demands distinguishable existence → T3 demands recursive closure → closure cycles must preserve both existence and distinction → spatial embedding creates rotational invariance → π emerges as C/d ratio

## Detailed Mathematical Derivation

### From Existential Difference to the Role of π

We can trace how **π** becomes necessary starting from **A0 (Existential Difference)** through recursive closure requirements.

**1. Start with A0:**

$$\text{Existence}_\varepsilon \equiv \text{Distinguishability}_\varepsilon$$

Existence at resolution ε is equivalent to distinguishability at resolution ε. For any form to exist, it must be distinguishable from its context at the operational resolution.

**2. Persistence requirement (T3):**

From T3 (Recursivity): stable forms emerge only through recursive closure. For ∆ to persist as a distinguishable difference, it must undergo recursive embedding operations that eventually close: $R^n(∆) = ∆$.

**3. Closure constraint:**

Recursive closure $R^n(∆) = ∆$ means the difference returns to its original state after n operations. This creates a **closed cycle** of transformations that preserves the original distinction.

**4. Geometric manifestation:**

When recursive closure is embedded in continuous spatial contexts, closed cycles manifest as **rotational invariance**. The most fundamental rotational closure is a complete revolution.

**5. The invariant ratio:**

In any spatial embedding where rotation represents closure, the ratio of **path length to characteristic scale** becomes invariant. For circular rotation, this is:

$$\frac{\text{circumference}}{\text{diameter}} = \pi$$

**6. Why π from A0 + T3:**

- **A0** ensures existence requires distinguishability at resolution ε
- **T3** requires recursive closure for stable persistence
- **Closure cycles** preserve distinction through return to origin
- **Spatial embedding** expresses cycles as rotational invariance
- **π emerges** as the universal ratio governing rotational closure geometry

**Connection to primitive flow:**
- **∆**: Must maintain distinguishable existence at resolution ε
- **R(·)**: Creates recursive embedding cycles $R^n(∆) = ∆$
- **⊚**: Stabilizes closure through rotational invariance
- **F**: Rotational forms inherit π as their fundamental geometric ratio

π represents the **universal closure ratio** that emerges when recursive cycles (required for distinction preservation) are expressed in spatial geometric contexts.
