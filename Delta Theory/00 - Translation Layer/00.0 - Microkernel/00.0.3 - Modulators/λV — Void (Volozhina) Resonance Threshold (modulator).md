# λV — Void Resonance Threshold (Volozhina)

> Void‑facing modulator that sets the **receptivity/ignition threshold** at interfaces.

---

## Definition

λV governs the **sensitivity and stability** of boundaries. It tunes when a difference crossing an interface
will spark propagation vs be absorbed. In practice, λV shapes backpressure, saturation, and ignition/collapse edges.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F` — why primitive operations require this modulation

**Flow:** ∆ needs threshold control → R(·) requires tunable interface sensitivity → ⊚ needs modulated ignition/collapse thresholds → λV emerges to prevent noise flooding and signal starvation
**Core:** From c (propagation limit), φ (asymmetric bias) - interface rate control and ignition decisions
**Control:** Manages receptivity, interface stability, and boundary crossing thresholds

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the modulator into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Modulator concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Threshold | Feature exposure gate | `FeatureFlagThreshold` |
| Sensitivity | Interface backpressure | `RateLimiter`, `CircuitBreaker` |
| Attention | Signal-noise gate | `SNRThreshold`, `AttentionGate` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Modulator concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| Threshold | Readiness boundary | "We're not ready for this yet" |
| Sensitivity | Receptivity state | "Not now" - healthy boundary |
| Attention | Noticing threshold | What matters enough to see |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Gate threshold | Readiness | When difference can enter |
| Backpressure | Boundary strength | How system protects itself |
| Signal gate | Care threshold | What gets attention |

## Domain Mapping

Brief examples across domains showing both technical and humane angles:

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Ignition threshold | Natural barrier |
| Chemistry | Activation energy | Catalytic readiness |
| Biology | Receptor threshold | Sensory awareness |
| Social | Group entry bar | Trust boundary |
| Economy | Minimum viable size | Value threshold |
| Politics | Quorum requirement | Movement momentum |
| Networks | Rate limit | System protection |
| Cognition | Attention filter | Conscious threshold |

## Formal identity

- Global modulation: $\Delta(t) = ∇S(t) \times λV(t) \times ψA(t)$
- Gate semantics: for input signal $x$, propagation requires $x \geq λV$ under available $ψA$ and $∇S$ support

---

## Dependencies

**Constants:** ε (minimal signal), φ (imbalance tolerance), c (propagation ceiling)
**Role:** P- modulator controlling interface sensitivity and threshold crossings in SVA triad

## Conditions / Invariants

- Stability window: too low λV → noise floods; too high λV → starvation
- Hysteresis: separate on/off thresholds prevent thrashing
- Coupling: higher $ψA$ permits lower λV without collapse; higher $∇S$ may require higher λV
- Failure modes:
  - Under‑threshold: useful signals are dropped
  - Overload: uncontrolled resonance → collapse

---

## Cross‑register failure modes

- Technical: gate too low → noise flood; gate too high → starvation; missing hysteresis → thrash
- Humane: over‑openness → overwhelm; over‑closed → isolation; unclear readiness/consent → rupture
