# 01.2 - Composite Interface APIs (index)

> Higher-level APIs that combine primitives and patterns for sophisticated operations, providing integrated functionality that coordinates multiple system components.

---

## Module Overview

Composite Interface APIs provide sophisticated operational capabilities by combining multiple primitives and patterns into integrated, high-level interfaces. These APIs abstract complex coordination tasks into single, coherent operations while maintaining the theoretical integrity of the underlying components.

The composite interface APIs include:
- **FlowController:** Port + Router + Filter composition for intelligent flow management
- **StateManager:** Gate + Buffer + Memory composition for state coordination and identity preservation
- **CoherenceOrchestrator:** Phase + Recovery coordination for system resilience and distributed coherence

These APIs enable real-world applications to perform complex operations through simple, well-defined interfaces while ensuring proper coordination between all system components.

## Content Structure

| Interface | Components | Function | Primary Use Cases | Status |
|-----------|------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| [[FlowController (interface)]] | Port + Router + Filter | Intelligent flow management | Network routing, resource allocation, data streaming | Planned |
| [[StateManager (interface)]] | Gate + Buffer + Memory | State coordination | System state management, identity preservation, transaction control | Planned |
| [[CoherenceOrchestrator (interface)]] | Phase + Recovery | System resilience | Distributed coordination, fault tolerance, temporal synchronization | Planned |

Each interface provides:
- Integrated operations combining multiple primitives and patterns
- Simplified API surface hiding complex coordination logic
- Performance optimization through integrated implementation
- Dual-register semantics at higher abstraction levels

## Composition Patterns

### FlowController Composition Pattern
```
Integrated Flow Management:
Port.admit(flow) → Router.determine_path(flow, criteria) → Filter.assess_quality(flow) → routing_decision

Backpressure Management:
Port.monitor(capacity) → Buffer.check_availability() → Router.adjust_paths() → pressure_relief

Quality Optimization:
Filter.assess_quality() → Router.optimize_paths() → Port.adjust_admission() → quality_improvement
```

### StateManager Composition Pattern
```
State Transition Coordination:
Gate.evaluate(conditions) → Memory.preserve(current_state) → Buffer.prepare_transition() → transition_execution

Identity Preservation:
Memory.retain(identity) → Phase.synchronize(timing) → Recovery.validate(consistency) → identity_maintenance

Temporal Coherence:
Phase.coordinate(operations) → Buffer.manage_timing() → Gate.synchronize_transitions() → coherent_operation
```

### CoherenceOrchestrator Composition Pattern
```
Distributed Synchronization:
Phase.synchronize(components) → Recovery.assess_stability() → coordination_result

Fault Tolerance:
Recovery.detect_failures() → Phase.realign_timing() → resilience_response

System Resilience:
Recovery.validate_stability() → Phase.maintain_coherence() → system_health_status
```
