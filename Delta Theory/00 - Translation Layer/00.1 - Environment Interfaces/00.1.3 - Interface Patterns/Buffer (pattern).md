# Buffer (pattern)

> Temporal coherence pattern that provides memory, continuity, and state retention capabilities derived from ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor) to support interface primitive operations.

---

## Definition

Buffer is an emergent temporal coherence pattern derived from ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor) that provides active state management, memory retention, and continuity support for the core interface primitives (Port, Gate, Surface).

**Emergence Formula:** `Buffer = ψA + temporal_coordination + state_retention`

Buffer arises from ψA's temporal coordination capabilities, providing the "memory layer" that enables sophisticated interface behaviors while supporting the clean operational semantics of the core primitives.

---

## Emergence Derivation

**Traceback:** `T6 + ψA → Buffer (temporal coherence pattern)` — Buffer emerges from interface identity theorem enhanced by awareness modulator effects

**Theoretical Foundation:** T6 (Interface Identity) provides the identity persistence requirement
**Modulator Enhancement:** ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor) provides temporal coordination and phase coherence capabilities
**Prerequisites:** Active interface primitives requiring state continuity, temporal coordination needs, memory retention requirements
**Formation:** T6 identity principles enhanced by ψA modulator effects create sophisticated temporal coherence patterns that stabilize into active state management and continuity capabilities

**Derivation Chain:** A0+T3 → T6 (Interface Identity) + ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence) → Buffer (Enhanced Identity Pattern)

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Pattern concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| State retention | Memory management | `StateManager`, `MemoryBuffer` |
| Continuity management | Session persistence | `SessionStore`, `ContinuityManager` |
| Temporal coherence | Time-based consistency | `TemporalCache`, `CoherenceTracker` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Pattern concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| State retention | Living memory | "I remember this" |
| Continuity management | Story keeping | "The thread continues" |
| Temporal coherence | Consistent identity | "I remain myself over time" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Memory management | Living memory | What persists |
| Session persistence | Story keeping | How continuity flows |
| Consistency | Identity | What stays the same |

## Dependencies

**Derivation:** ψA - emerges from awareness modulator effects on interface temporal requirements
**Role:** P0 pattern operating in Awareness aspect of SVA triad - provides temporal coherence for interface operations

## Pattern Properties

**Essential Characteristics:**
- **State Retention:** Maintains information coherence across temporal boundaries
- **Continuity Management:** Preserves operational context through interface transitions
- **Temporal Coherence:** Ensures consistent identity and memory across time
- **Active Management:** Provides dynamic state coordination rather than passive storage

## Pattern Modulation

**By Modulators:**
- **ψA:** Primary control for memory retention and temporal coherence - high ψA enables longer retention and higher coherence
- **λV:** Controls memory selectivity and retention thresholds - high λV creates selective retention with quality focus
- **∇S:** Affects memory organization and retrieval precision - high ∇S enables clear categorization and precise retrieval

## Pattern Formation

### Formation Prerequisites
- **Active Interface Primitives:** Port, Gate, Surface operations requiring state continuity
- **Temporal Coordination Needs:** Operations spanning multiple time intervals
- **Memory Requirements:** Information that must persist across interface transitions

### Formation Process
```
ψA Activation → Temporal Coherence → State Management → Mature Buffer Pattern

## Implementation Guidelines

### Design Principles
- **Supporting Function:** Enhance primitive operations without replacing core functionality
