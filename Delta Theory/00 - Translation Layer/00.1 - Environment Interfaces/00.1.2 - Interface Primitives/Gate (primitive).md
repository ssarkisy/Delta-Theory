# Gate (Threshold Control Interface)

> **Gate** is the **threshold evaluation primitive** — monitoring conditions and controlling activation states.

---

## Definition

Gate is not a switch or barrier. It is the **active threshold monitoring operation** that evaluates conditions and manages state transitions while maintaining temporal coherence.

## Dual-register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Threshold monitoring | Condition evaluation | `ThresholdMonitor`, `ConditionWatcher` |
| State transition | Activation control | `StateController`, `TriggerManager` |
| Timing control | Synchronization | `TimingGate`, `SyncController` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Threshold monitoring | Readiness sensing | "Is it time yet?" |
| State transition | Decision moment | "Now we act" |
| Timing control | Rhythm keeping | "Wait for the right moment" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Condition evaluation | Readiness check | When things are ready |
| Activation control | Decision point | When to act |
| Synchronization | Rhythm keeping | How timing aligns |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Threshold Check | `gate.evaluate(conditions)` | "Are we ready?" |
| State Transition | `gate.activate(trigger)` | "Now we go" |
| Timing Control | `gate.sync(phase)` | "Wait for the beat" |
| Reset | `gate.reset()` | "Start fresh" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | λV Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Sensitivity | Threshold level | Responsiveness | High λV = higher threshold |
| Timing | Activation delay | Patience level | Low λV = faster response |
| Hysteresis | State memory | Decision stickiness | λV modulates memory depth |
| Recovery | Reset time | Rest period | High λV = longer recovery |

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Energy threshold | Activation barrier |
| Chemistry | Reaction threshold | Chemical trigger |
| Biology | Action potential | Neural firing |
| Social | Decision threshold | Group consensus |
| Economy | Price threshold | Market trigger |
| Politics | Voting threshold | Decision point |
| Networks | Protocol threshold | System activation |
| Cognition | Awareness threshold | Recognition moment |

## Stability Conditions

- **Threshold Consistency:** Activation levels remain stable under similar conditions
- **Timing Accuracy:** State transitions occur at appropriate moments
- **Recovery Integrity:** Gates return to ready state after activation
- **Hysteresis Control:** State memory prevents oscillation

---

## Modulator Effects

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold) — Microkernel
Controls interface sensitivity and threshold behavior:
- **High λV:** Higher activation thresholds, more stable gates, slower responses
- **Low λV:** Lower activation thresholds, more sensitive gates, faster responses
- **Source:** Microkernel modulator (00.0.3) affecting all interface operations

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient) — Microkernel
Affects boundary clarity and threshold definition:
- **High ∇S:** Sharper thresholds, clearer state distinctions
- **Low ∇S:** Softer thresholds, gradual state transitions
- **Source:** Microkernel modulator (00.0.3) affecting boundary formation

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor) — Microkernel
Manages temporal coordination and phase alignment:
- **Controls:** Timing precision across multiple gates
- **Function:** Temporal coherence in threshold operations
- **Source:** Microkernel modulator (00.0.3) affecting time-dependent operations

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Gate Interface:
- evaluate(conditions) → readiness_level
- activate(trigger) → state_transition
- sync(phase) → timing_adjustment
- configure(threshold, timing, hysteresis)
```

### Error Conditions
- **Conservation Violation:** Flow imbalance through gate (violates σ_conservation)
- **Timing Drift:** Conservation accounting timing loss (violates σ_conservation)
- **False Activation:** Trigger without proper flow accounting (violates σ_conservation)
- **Missed Trigger:** Conservation requirements met but no activation (violates σ_conservation)
- **Stuck State:** Cannot return to conservation-compliant state (violates σ_conservation)

---

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** [[Port (primitive)]] → Gate → [[Surface (primitive)]]
- **Controls:** Gate timing affects Surface exposure through conservation monitoring
- **Dependencies:** Receives flow conditions from Port for conservation evaluation
- **Constants:** Operates within σ_conservation timing constraints for flow accounting

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Foundation:** Gate emerges from Interface Theorems as operational implementation

**From T4 (Interface Conservation):** Gates implement conservation monitoring through threshold control
- Conservation requires flow accounting → threshold monitoring for flow balance
- T4 demands accountable difference preservation → Gate provides conservation evaluation
- Mathematical basis: σ_conservation constant governs conservation accounting timing

**Structural Foundation:** Built upon microkernel primitives ∆, R(·), ⊚ with interface-specific application:
- **∆ (Difference):** condition/no-condition distinction enables threshold detection
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** context determines appropriate thresholds
- **⊚ (Stabilization):** ensures consistent activation policies

**Interface Layer Extension:** Theorems T5, T6 specify **what** gates must do; structural primitives provide **how** gates operate.

---

## Interface Constants Integration

Gate operations must respect interface timing constraints:
- **σ_conservation:** Gate conservation monitoring limited by conservation accounting rate (1-100ms intervals)
- **Supporting constants:** κ_discrimination and ι_identity provide coordination with Port and Surface operations

**Implementation Requirement:** All gate threshold evaluations and conservation monitoring must occur within σ_conservation timing bounds to maintain flow accountability.

---

## Design rationale

Gate follows dual-register governance so threshold control remains intelligible both as technical condition monitoring and as humane readiness sensing without reducing one to the other.
