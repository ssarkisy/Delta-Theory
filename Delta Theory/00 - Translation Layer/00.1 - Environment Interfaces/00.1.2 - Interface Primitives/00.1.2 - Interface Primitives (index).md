# 00.1.2 - Interface Primitives (index)

> Core interface operations derived from structural primitives: Port (flow control), Gate (threshold control), Surface (boundary control).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental interface primitives that enable controlled field interaction, derived from the full structural primitive sequence (∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F):

- **Port:** Flow control and directional management (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to flow contexts)
- **Gate:** Threshold activation and condition monitoring (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to threshold contexts)
- **Surface:** Boundary exposure and permeability control (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to boundary contexts)

These primitives work together as the **core interface operations** that implement structure-field interaction. They are supported by Operational Patterns (such as Buffer) which provide additional capabilities derived from modulator effects.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Interface Primitives | Core operations | [[Port (primitive)]], [[Gate (primitive)]], [[Surface (primitive)]] |
| Primitive Derivation | Structural grounding | ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to flow/threshold/boundary contexts |
| Theorem Mapping | Grounding principles | T3 → Port, T4 → Surface, T5 → Gate |
| Operational Flow | Interface sequence | Port (receive) → Gate (evaluate) → Surface (expose) |
| Support Patterns | Enhancement functions | Extended patterns (when implemented) |
| Modulator Effects | Control parameters | λV (threshold), ∇S (boundary), ψA (coherence) |

Each primitive provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Operational semantics
- Control interfaces
- Domain manifestations

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Derivation**
   - All interface primitives derive from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to specific contexts
   - Port: flow context, Gate: threshold context, Surface: boundary context
   - Each primitive implements the full structural sequence in its domain

2. **Theorem Grounding**
   - Port operations implement T3 (Interface Discrimination) principles
   - Surface operations implement T4 (Interface Identity) principles
   - Gate operations implement T5 (Interface Conservation) principles

3. **Interface Coordination**
   - Primitives work together as coordinated interface operations
   - Canonical sequence: Port (receive) → Gate (evaluate) → Surface (expose)
   - Each primitive respects interface constants (κ_discrimination, ι_identity, σ_conservation)
