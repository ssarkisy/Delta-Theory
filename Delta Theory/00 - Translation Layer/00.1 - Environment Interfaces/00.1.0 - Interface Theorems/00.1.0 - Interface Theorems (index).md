# 00.1.0 - Interface Theorems (index)

> Derived theorems governing how structure interacts with fields through boundaries, ports, and surfaces - proven consequences of the foundational axiom A0 and microkernel theorems T1, T2, T3.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the fundamental theorems that govern interface behavior, derived from the foundational axiom and microkernel theorems:

- **T4 — Interface Conservation:** Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries (derived from A0 + T3)
- **T5 — Interface Discrimination:** Interfaces must discriminate between flows (derived from A0 + T2)
- **T6 — Interface Identity:** Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity (derived from A0 + T1)

These theorems ensure that field interaction maintains structural stability while enabling controlled exchange with the environment.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Interface Theorems | Derived consequences | [[T4 — Interface Conservation (theorem)]], [[T5 — Interface Discrimination (theorem)]], [[T6 — Interface Identity (theorem)]] |
| Axiom Derivation | Core foundations | T4 ← A0+T3, T5 ← A0+T2, T6 ← A0+T1 |
| Stability Conditions | Required invariants | Conservation, Discrimination, Identity |
| Control Relations | Modulator effects | λV (void/flow), ∇S (structure/boundary), ψA (awareness/coherence) |

Each theorem provides:
- Formal derivation from foundational axiom A0 + microkernel theorems
- Technical and humane interpretations
- Interface primitive mapping
- Domain manifestations
- Stability requirements

## Key Principles

1. **Axiom Derivation**
   - T4 (Conservation) ← A0 (Existential Difference) + T3 (Recursivity)
   - T5 (Discrimination) ← A0 (Existential Difference) + T2 (Asymmetry)
   - T6 (Identity) ← A0 (Existential Difference) + T1 (Irreducibility)

2. **Interface Stability**
   - Conservation preserves difference across boundaries (P+ Structure)
   - Discrimination enables selective flow control (P- Void)
   - Identity maintains boundary coherence (P0 Awareness)

3. **Theorem Applications**
   - T4 governs Gate operations (flow conservation)
   - T5 governs Port operations (flow discrimination)
   - T6 governs Surface operations (boundary identity)
