# 00.1.0 - Interface Theorems (index)

> Derived theorems governing how structure interacts with fields through boundaries, ports, and surfaces - proven consequences of the core axioms A1, T1, T2.

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the fundamental theorems that govern interface behavior, derived from the core microkernel axioms:

- **T3 — Interface Discrimination:** Interfaces must discriminate between flows (derived from T1 + A1)
- **T4 — Interface Identity:** Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity (derived from T2 + A1)
- **T5 — Interface Conservation:** Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries (derived from A1 + T2)

These theorems ensure that field interaction maintains structural stability while enabling controlled exchange with the environment.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Interface Theorems | Derived consequences | [[T3 — Interface Discrimination (theorem)]], [[T4 — Interface Identity (theorem)]], [[T5 — Interface Conservation (theorem)]] |
| Axiom Derivation | Core foundations | T3 ← T1+A1, T4 ← T2+A1, T5 ← A1+T2 |
| Stability Conditions | Required invariants | Discrimination, Coherence, Conservation |
| Control Relations | Modulator effects | λV (primary), ∇S (boundary), ψA (coherence) |

Each theorem provides:
- Formal derivation from core axioms
- Technical and humane interpretations
- Interface primitive mapping
- Domain manifestations
- Stability requirements

## Key Principles

1. **Axiom Derivation**
   - T3 (Discrimination) ← T1 (Asymmetry) + A1 (Irreducibility)
   - T4 (Identity) ← T2 (Recursivity) + A1 (Irreducibility)
   - T5 (Conservation) ← A1 (Irreducibility) + T2 (Recursivity)

2. **Interface Stability**
   - Discrimination enables selective flow control
   - Identity maintains boundary coherence
   - Conservation preserves difference across boundaries

3. **Theorem Applications**
   - T3 governs Port operations (flow discrimination)
   - T4 governs Surface operations (boundary coherence)
   - T5 governs Gate operations (flow conservation)
