# 00.1 - Environment Interfaces (index)

> Extension of the microkernel for environment interaction: specialized theorems, constants, primitives, and patterns that enable controlled interface with external domains.

---

## Module Overview

Environment Interfaces extend the microkernel with specialized components that enable safe, controlled interaction with external environments. While maintaining theoretical consistency with microkernel foundations, these interfaces provide the operational flexibility needed for domain-specific applications.

The interface layer includes:
- **Interface Theorems:** Extended theorems (T4, T5, T6) that govern interface behavior
- **Interface Constants:** Operational constants (σ, κ, ι) that control interface rates
- **Interface Primitives:** Specialized primitives (Port, Gate, Surface) for environment interaction
- **Interface Patterns:** Operational patterns (Router, Filter, Buffer) that support interface functions

This interface layer provides controlled extension of microkernel capabilities while preserving theoretical integrity.

## Key Principles

1. **Controlled Extension**
   - Interface layer provides controlled extension of microkernel capabilities
   - All interface components must derive from microkernel foundations (A0, T1, T2, T3)
   - Interface complexity emerges from microkernel simplicity through controlled extension

2. **SVA Canonical Progression**
   - All interface components follow canonical P+ → P- → P0 progression
   - Structure (P+): Conservation, σ_conservation, Gate, Router
   - Void (P-): Discrimination, κ_discrimination, Port, Filter
   - Awareness (P0): Identity, ι_identity, Surface, Buffer
   - Consistent polarity alignment across all interface layers

3. **Progressive Specialization**
   - Start with microkernel foundations (A0, T1, T2, T3)
   - Add interface theorems (T4, T5, T6) for extended capabilities
   - Implement interface constants (σ, κ, ι) and primitives (Gate, Port, Surface) for operational control
   - Deploy interface patterns (Router, Filter, Buffer) for enhanced functionality
