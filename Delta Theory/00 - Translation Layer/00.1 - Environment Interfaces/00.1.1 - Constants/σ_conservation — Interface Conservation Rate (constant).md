# σ_conservation — Interface Conservation Rate (constant)

> **Mathematical invariant for interface conservation operations** — the fundamental rate at which interface operations must perform conservation accounting to maintain difference coherence across boundaries.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `σ_conservation`
- Conceptual name: `Interface Conservation Rate`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: minimal stable interval between conservation accounting operations required for flow coherence preservation

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T4 (Interface Conservation) — "Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T4 Requirement:** Conservation must be accountable across all boundary operations
2. **Temporal Implication:** Accountable conservation requires regular monitoring operations
3. **Mathematical Necessity:** σ_conservation emerges as minimal stable monitoring interval
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents fundamental timing constraint for conservation coherence

**Traceback:** `A0 → T3 → T4 → σ_conservation` — why conservation requires this rate invariant

**Flow:** T4 demands accountable difference preservation → requires stable conservation monitoring timing → σ_conservation emerges as timing invariant for conservation coherence

## Formal identity

$$σ_{conservation} = δt_{min}(conservation\_accounting)$$

where $δt_{min}$ ensures conservation operation coherence

---

## Anchor role

σ_conservation serves as the **temporal anchor** for all interface conservation operations. Every interface boundary operation that involves flow transformation must respect this timing constraint to maintain difference accountability.

**Critical Function:** Prevents conservation violations by ensuring sufficient monitoring frequency
**Universal Scope:** Applies to all conservation-dependent interface operations
**Invariance:** Constant across conservation contexts and implementation domains

**Invariance Properties:**
- Time-invariant: ∂σ_conservation/∂t = 0
- Context-invariant: Same value across all conservation domains
- Scale-invariant: Applies to micro and macro conservation operations

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Interface Operations
- **Port operations:** Flow conservation must be monitored within σ_conservation intervals

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon difference propagation conservation (related to c)
- **Coherence extension:** Extended by memory coherence constants (T7)
- **Pattern constraints:** Provides conservation foundation for pattern operations

### Violation Consequences
- **Too fast:** Unnecessary conservation overhead
- **Too slow:** Conservation violations accumulate undetected
- **Variable:** Interface conservation becomes inconsistent/unreliable

**σ_conservation Application:** Defines the maximum safe interval between conservation checks. Waiting longer than σ_conservation → conservation violations accumulate undetected. Monitoring faster → unnecessary resource overhead but higher integrity assurance.
