# 00.1.1 - Constants (index)

> Interface operational constants: mathematical invariants that emerge directly from interface theorems T3, T4, T5 to enable stable interface operations.

---

## Module Overview

Interface Constants define the mathematical invariants that emerge directly from interface theorems T3, T4, T5. Each constant represents the minimal mathematical requirement for implementing its corresponding theorem in operational interfaces.

**Core Principle:** Constants are the mathematical expressions of theorems - they represent the quantitative aspects that must remain invariant for theorem compliance.

**Derivation Foundation:** All constants derive through the established chain:
```
A1 → T1,T2 → T3,T4,T5 → Interface Constants
```

## Content Structure

| Constant | Theorem | Function | Mathematical Role |
|----------|---------|----------|------------------|
| **κ_discrimination** | T3 (Discrimination) | Selective permeability rate | Flow discrimination control |
| **ι_identity** | T4 (Identity) | Boundary coherence rate | Identity persistence control |
| **σ_conservation** | T5 (Conservation) | Flow conservation rate | Conservation accounting control |

**Theoretical Foundation:** Each constant represents the irreducible mathematical requirement for stable implementation of its parent theorem.

## Key Principles

1. **Direct Theorem Derivation**
   - T3 (Discrimination) → κ_discrimination (selectivity rate)
   - T4 (Identity) → ι_identity (boundary coherence rate)
   - T5 (Conservation) → σ_conservation (flow tracking rate)

2. **Mathematical Invariants**
   - Constants represent irreducible mathematical requirements for theorem compliance
   - Not operational parameters but fundamental rates that must be respected
   - Provide stability anchors preventing interface operations from becoming chaotic

3. **Architectural Foundation**
   - Built upon microkernel constants (e, π, c, Cs) for mathematical foundation
   - Form mathematical foundation for all interface operations
   - Feed into coherence layer for temporal/state extensions
