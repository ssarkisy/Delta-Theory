# φ — Golden Ratio (constant)

> Dimensionless proportion anchoring optimal partitioning and self‑similar growth.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: φ
- Name: Golden Ratio
- Value: 1.618033988749894… (dimensionless)
- Definition: positive root of $x^2 = x + 1$; limit of consecutive Fibonacci ratios

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- $\varphi = \dfrac{1 + \sqrt{5}}{2}$
- $\varphi = \lim_{n\to\infty} \dfrac{F_{n+1}}{F_n}$

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes asymmetric partitioning (cut where whole:part = part:remainder)
- Appears in self‑similar structures and efficient search/spacing
