# e — Euler’s Number (constant)

> Dimensionless base of natural growth and decay; anchors continuous compounding.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: e
- Name: Euler’s Number
- Value: 2.718281828459045… (dimensionless)
- Definition: base of the natural logarithm; limit of continuous compounding

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- $e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \tfrac{1}{n}\right)^n$
- $\dfrac{d}{dx} e^x = e^x$; $\int \dfrac{1}{x}\,dx = \ln|x| + C$

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes exponential growth/decay processes
- Fundamental to differential equations and stability analysis
