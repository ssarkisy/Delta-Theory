# π — Circle Constant (constant)

> Dimensionless ratio anchoring rotations, waves, and circular measure.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: π
- Name: Circle Constant (Pi)
- Value: 3.141592653589793… (dimensionless)
- Definition: ratio of circumference to diameter of a Euclidean circle

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- $\pi = \dfrac{C}{D}$
- $\pi = 4 \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \dfrac{(-1)^k}{2k+1}$
- $\pi = 2 \int_0^1 \dfrac{1}{1+x^2}\,dx$

---

## Anchor role

- Normalizes circular/rotational structures (angles, spectra, modes)
- Bridges geometry and analysis (Fourier basis, harmonic cycles)

---

## Scope & invariance

- Holds in Euclidean geometry; interpretations differ in non‑Euclidean spaces
