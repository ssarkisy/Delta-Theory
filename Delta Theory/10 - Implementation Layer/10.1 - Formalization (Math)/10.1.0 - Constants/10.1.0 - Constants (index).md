# Math — Anchors (meta)

> Mathematical implementations of core constants (π, e, φ).
> Shows how abstract concepts manifest in formal systems while maintaining humane meaning.

---

## Scope

This module implements core constants in mathematical form:

1. π — Circle constant (closure geometry)
2. e — Euler's number (natural growth)
3. φ — Golden ratio (asymmetric stability)

Each implementation must maintain both technical precision and humane understanding.

## Dual‑register mapping

Map mathematical implementations into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (mathematical/formal)

| Constant | Mathematical construct | Implementation example |
|----------|----------------------|----------------------|
| π | Circle ratio | `Math.PI`, geometric series |
| e | Natural base | `Math.E`, limit definition |
| φ | Golden mean | `(1 + √5)/2`, Fibonacci limit |

### Humane (experiential/intuitive)

| Constant | Humane construct | Example |
|----------|-----------------|---------|
| π | Natural cycles | Full circle return |
| e | Organic growth | Natural unfolding |
| φ | Pleasant proportion | Beautiful balance |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Math term | Humane term | Implementation meaning |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Ratio | Cycle | How closure completes |
| Base | Growth | How change compounds |
| Mean | Balance | How parts relate |

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Mathematical Implementation**
   - Use precise definitions
   - Specify computation methods
   - Define error bounds

2. **Humane Preservation**
   - Keep intuitive meaning
   - Show natural examples
   - Explain relationships

3. **Bridge Requirements**
   - Document both aspects
   - Show connections
   - Test both registers

## Stability Conditions

| Aspect | Technical requirement | Humane requirement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Definition | Mathematical precision | Intuitive clarity |
| Usage | Computational efficiency | Natural application |
| Testing | Numerical accuracy | Experiential validity |

## Design rationale

Mathematical implementations must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Each constant preserves both formal precision and humane meaning without reduction to either.
