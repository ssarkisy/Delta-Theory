## Definition

- Symbol: e
- Value: 2.718281828459045... (dimensionless)
- Primary: Base of natural logarithm
- Precision: Double precision (≈1e-15) typically sufficient

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the implementation into both registers while preserving core meaning.

### Technical (mathematical)

| Implementation | Mathematical construct | Code example |
|----------------|----------------------|--------------|
| Value | Transcendental number | `Math.E` |
| Series | Taylor expansion | `sum(1/k!)` |
| Limit | Compound interest | `(1 + 1/n)^n` |

### Humane (experiential)

| Implementation | Natural example | Experience |
|----------------|----------------|------------|
| Value | Growth rate | Natural pace |
| Series | Step accumulation | Building up |
| Limit | Smooth growth | Flowing change |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Math term | Natural term | Implementation meaning |
|-----------|-------------|----------------------|
| Base | Pace | How change flows |
| Series | Steps | How to compute |
| Limit | Growth | How to measure |

## Implementation Details

### Primary Formulas

1. **Series definition**
   $$e = \sum_{k=0}^{\infty} \frac{1}{k!}$$
   (Taylor series at 0)

2. **Limit definition**
   $$e = \lim_{n \to \infty} \left(1 + \frac{1}{n}\right)^n$$
   (compound interest limit)

3. **Differential form**
   $$\frac{d}{dx}e^x = e^x$$
   (unique self-derivative)

### Usage Guidelines

1. **Precision**
   - Use built-in Math.E when possible
   - Double precision sufficient for most uses
   - Specify precision needs explicitly

2. **Performance**
   - Cache e value, don't recompute
   - Use built-in exp/log functions
   - Consider lookup tables for speed

3. **Validation**
   - Test against known decimals
   - Verify growth properties
   - Check differential behavior

## Scope & Constraints

- Natural base for exponential growth
- Optimal rate for continuous change
- Computational approximations sufficient

---

## Design rationale

This implementation maintains dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Mathematical precision is balanced with natural understanding.
