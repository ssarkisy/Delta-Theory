# Physics — Anchors (meta)

> Domain‑specific anchors for Physics. Keep the ontological core compact; store physics constants here and link from core indices.

---

## Purpose

Collect physics‑specific constants/anchors (e.g., c, α, ħ, k_B) used by domain models and implementations.

---

## Contents

- [[c — Speed of Light in Vacuum (constant)]] — max propagation speed in vacuum (defines meter)
- [[ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)]] — quantum of action; phase quantization
- [[k_B — Boltzmann Constant (constant)]] — links temperature to energy; thermal noise scale
- [[α — Fine-Structure Constant (constant)]] — EM coupling strength (dimensionless)
