# α — Fine-Structure Constant (constant)

> Dimensionless electromagnetic coupling strength; anchors interaction magnitude in QED.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: α
- Name: Fine-Structure Constant
- Value: ≈ 7.2973525693×10⁻³ (≈ 1/137.035999...) (dimensionless; CODATA approx)
- Definition: electromagnetic coupling constant; dimensionless ratio

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- In SI: $\alpha = \dfrac{e^2}{4\pi \varepsilon_0 \hbar c}$
- In Gaussian units: $\alpha = \dfrac{e^2}{\hbar c}$

---

## Anchor role

- Sets strength of electromagnetic interactions (spectra, cross‑sections)
- Governs fine structure of atomic levels and scattering amplitudes
- Bridges constants $e, \hbar, c$ via a unit‑free ratio

---

## Scope & invariance

- Dimensionless; value independent of units; measured (not defined exactly)
- Precision and context (vacuum, low‑energy limit) should be specified for calculations
