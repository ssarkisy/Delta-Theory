# Physics — Anchors (meta)

> Physical implementations of core constants and domain-specific anchors.
> Shows how abstract concepts manifest in physical reality while maintaining humane meaning.

---

## Scope

This module implements physics-specific constants:

1. c — Speed of light (propagation limit)
2. ħ — Reduced Planck constant (action quantum)
3. k_B — Boltzmann constant (thermal scale)
4. α — Fine structure constant (coupling)

Each implementation must maintain both physical precision and humane understanding.

## Dual‑register mapping

Map physical implementations into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (physical/formal)

| Constant | Physical construct | Implementation example |
|----------|-------------------|----------------------|
| c | Light speed | `c = 299792458` |
| ħ | Action quantum | `h/(2π)` |
| k_B | Energy scale | `k_B * T` |
| α | Coupling | `e^2/(ħc)` |

### Humane (experiential/intuitive)

| Constant | Natural example | Experience |
|----------|----------------|------------|
| c | Causal limit | "Can't go faster" |
| ħ | Quantum jump | "Discrete steps" |
| k_B | Heat flow | "Feels warmer" |
| α | Interaction | "Things affect each other" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Physics term | Humane term | Implementation meaning |
|-------------|-------------|----------------------|
| Speed limit | Causality | How fast difference moves |
| Quantum | Step | How small changes can be |
| Temperature | Warmth | How energy flows |
| Coupling | Connection | How things interact |

## Implementation Strategy

1. **Physical Definition**
   - SI units and values
   - Measurement standards
   - Precision requirements

2. **Humane Connection**
   - Observable effects
   - Natural examples
   - Experiential tests

3. **Bridge Maintenance**
   - Clear documentation
   - Example mappings
   - Usage guidance

---

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Physical Implementation**
   - Use SI definitions
   - Specify units clearly
   - Note precision limits

2. **Humane Preservation**
   - Keep intuitive meaning
   - Show natural examples
   - Explain relationships

3. **Bridge Requirements**
   - Document both aspects
   - Show connections
   - Test both registers

## Stability Conditions

| Aspect | Physical requirement | Humane requirement |
|--------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Definition | SI precision | Observable clarity |
| Usage | Unit consistency | Natural application |
| Testing | Measurement accuracy | Experiential validity |

---

## Design rationale

Physical implementations must maintain dual-register intelligibility per governance (see [PRINCIPLES.md](../../../../../../PRINCIPLES.md)). Each constant preserves both formal precision and humane meaning without reduction to either.
