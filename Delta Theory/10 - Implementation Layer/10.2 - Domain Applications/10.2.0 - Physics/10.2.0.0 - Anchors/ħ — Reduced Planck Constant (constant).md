# ħ — Reduced Planck Constant (constant)

> Quantum of action; sets phase quantization. Physics instance of ε (difference resolution) at quantum scale.

## Definition

- Symbol: ħ
- Name: Reduced Planck Constant
- Value: ≈ 1.054 571 817×10⁻³⁴ J·s (CODATA)
- Definition: ħ = h / (2π); relates energy–frequency (E = ħω) and momentum–wavenumber (p = ħk)

---

## Anchor role

- Sets minimal action quantum; governs discrete phase steps
- Appears in quantization conditions and interference phase evolution
