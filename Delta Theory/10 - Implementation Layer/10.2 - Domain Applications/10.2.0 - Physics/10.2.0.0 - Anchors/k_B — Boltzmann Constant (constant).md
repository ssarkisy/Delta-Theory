## Definition

- Symbol: k_B
- Name: Boltzmann Constant
- Value: 1.380 649×10⁻²³ J·K⁻¹ (exact, SI)
- Definition: exact by SI; sets k_B T energy scale per degree of freedom in thermal systems

---

## Anchor role

- Relates entropy/temperature to energy; sets noise floor for physical information channels
