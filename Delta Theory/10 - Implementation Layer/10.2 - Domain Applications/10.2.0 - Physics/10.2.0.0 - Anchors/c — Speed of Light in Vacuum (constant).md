# c — Maximum Propagation Speed (physics: speed of light) (constant)

> Conceptual: maximum difference propagation speed through the Void.
> Physics instantiation: exact speed of light in vacuum (defines the meter).

---

## Definition

- Symbol: c
- Name: Speed of Light in Vacuum
- Value: 299 792 458 m/s (exact, by SI definition)
- Definition: exact value defining the meter via distance = $c \cdot$ time

---

## Formal identity (if applicable)

- $x = c\,t$ (null interval); invariant speed in special relativity
- Metric signature with $c$ sets Lorentz transformations and light cones

---

## Anchor role

- Sets the maximum signal/causal propagation speed
- Ties space and time units; anchors electromagnetism and relativity
- Appears in $E = mc^2$ and wave equations

---

## Scope & invariance

- Exact by SI; applies to vacuum; media have $v < c$
- Coordinate choices may set $c=1$ (natural units) for convenience
