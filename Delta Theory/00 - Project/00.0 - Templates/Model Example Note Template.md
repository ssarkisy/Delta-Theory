# [ExampleName] (Model Example)

## Essence

This example illustrates how **[ExampleName]** embodies the structural flow of ∆‑Theory — from **Primitive Differences** to **Constructs, Specs, and emergent Models**.  
It demonstrates how difference, once structured and stabilized, propagates into a functional system observable in everyday life.

|**Spec**|⟪Define the operational rule or logic chain governing system behavior⟫|
|**Model**|⟪This specific instantiation of the concept — the physical object, system, or conceptual model⟫|
