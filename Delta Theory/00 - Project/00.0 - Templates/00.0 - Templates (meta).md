# 00.0 – Templates Overview

This note defines the **structural role of the Templates folder** in the ∆‑Theory Knowledge Base. It provides a centralized collection of **note scaffolding patterns**, ensuring that every file created in the system adheres to **consistent structural roles, frontmatter fields, and traceability principles**.

---

## Purpose of the Templates Folder

- Houses **predefined note templates** for each structural note type:
    
    - Ontology Notes
        
    - Property Notes
        
    - Construct Notes
        
    - Spec Notes
        
    - Model Notes (General + Example-specific)
        
- Serves as a **canonical reference for formatting, frontmatter fields, and section structures**.
    
- Ensures that all new notes are created with **traceability logic embedded from inception**.
    

## Available Templates

|Template|Purpose|
|---|---|
|[[Ontology Note Template]]|Defines primitives, recursive structures, or derived configurations.|
|[[Property Note Template]]|Describes qualifying attributes modulating Ontology or Constructs.|
|[[Construct Note Template]]|Outlines emergent functional configurations from property synthesis.|
|[[Spec Note Template]]|Formalizes operators, predicates, rules, metrics, or generators.|
|[[Model Note Template]]|Documents domain-specific realizations of Ontology-Spec structures.|
|[[Model Example Note Template]]|Simplified structure for practical, illustrative Model examples.|


## Usage Instructions

- **When creating a new note**, duplicate the relevant template from this folder.
    
- Ensure:
    
    - Frontmatter fields are filled accurately (`type`, `domain`, `aliases`, etc.).
        
    - Structural sections (Definition, Role, Inputs, Outputs, Traceability) are included.
        
- Link the new note to its upstream Ontology and downstream Spec/Model chain where applicable.
    

## Relation to Knowledge Base Architecture

- Templates directly enforce the structural principles defined in:
    
    - [[Knowledge Base Architecture]]
        
    - [[Roadmap and Development]]
        
- They are essential for maintaining:
    
    - Cross-layer traceability (Ontology ↔ Spec ↔ Model).
        
    - Consistent navigation logic within Obsidian’s graph view.
        
    - Minimal yet scalable structural expansion as the Knowledge Base grows.
        

## Folder Maintenance Guidelines

- Templates should be **version-controlled**.
    
- Any modification to template structure must be reflected in:
    
    - [[Knowledge Base Architecture]]
        
    - Notes derived from the affected template.
        
- Add new templates here as new structural types (e.g., Axioms, Taxonomies) are introduced.
