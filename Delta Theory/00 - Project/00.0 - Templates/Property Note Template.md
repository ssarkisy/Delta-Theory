## Definition / Essence

> ⟪Provide a concise, plain-language definition⟫  
What **is** this property?  
What aspect of the Ontology Entity does it **qualify, measure, or enable**?

Clarify its **ontological function**:
- What stabilizes?
- What persists?
- What modulates?
- How does this property **affect the structural difference and emergent constructs**?

## Formal Expression <if applicable>

If this Property is defined or evaluated through a formal Spec, express it symbolically.

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$F$|Qualified Ontology Entity (e.g., Form, Field)|
|$∆$|Primitive Difference|
|$R(∆)$|Relational Embedding|
|$⊚$|Stabilization Operator|
|$P$|This Property (qualitative or evaluative function)|

**Example (Coherence Predicate):**
$$
P_{coherence}(F) ⇔ ∀ R(∆) ∈ F:\ PhaseAlignment(R(∆)) \land TensionBalance(R(∆))
$$

## Role in ∆‑Theory

Explain the **functional role** of this Property:
- Does it qualify **structural coherence** or **stabilization thresholds**?
- Is it a **Persistence Enabler**, **Collapse Modulator**, or **Interaction Amplifier**?

## Usage & Application

Explain how this Property is **used in modeling, diagnostics, or dynamic reasoning**:
- **Structural Evaluation** — e.g., assessing persistence or coherence in Forms.
- **Cross-Domain Modeling** — how this Property manifests in physics, cognition, systems.
- **System Transitions** — modulates stabilization → collapse dynamics.
- **Recursive Dynamics** — behavior across embedding layers (amplification, attenuation, distribution).

## Examples / Case Studies

|Domain|Manifestation|
|---|---|
|Physics|E.g., Coherence of a particle’s recursive difference loop maintaining phase-aligned tension|
|Cognition|E.g., Stability of self-identity loop through balanced feedback (TensionBalance & Coherence)|
|Systems|E.g., Persistent organizational feedback loops relying on recursive tension distribution|

Provide real-world analogs to aid comprehension of abstract structures.

## Notes

- All Property notes should maintain **traceability to Ontology, Construct, and (if applicable) Spec**.
- Properties often **serve as enablers for higher-level Constructs** — e.g., ClosureStrength enabling Persistence.
- For properties used in multiple constructs, link them in the **Related Notes** section, but keep the primary traceability chain clear.
