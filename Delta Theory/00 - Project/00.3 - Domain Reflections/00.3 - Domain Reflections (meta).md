# 00.3 – Domain Reflections

This note defines the **purpose and structural role of the Domain Reflections folder** in the ∆‑Theory Knowledge Base. It serves as a **cross-domain interface**, capturing how ∆‑Theory’s core principles manifest across different fields — from cognitive science to systems theory and computational models.


## Purpose of Domain Reflections

- To document **how foundational principles of difference propagation, recursive structuring, and stabilization manifest in diverse domains**.
    
- These notes translate **core theoretical constructs into contextualized reflections** in:
    
    - Cognitive science and identity loops.
        
    - Systems dynamics and feedback stabilization.
        
    - Digital graphics and structural geometry.
        
- Serve as **bridges between the abstract ontology layer and applied model examples**, providing theoretical depth for domain-specific implementations.


## Role in the Knowledge Base Architecture

|Function|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Theoretical Reflection Layer|These notes explore how core ∆‑Theory principles resonate in real-world domains.|
|Interpretation Guides|Provide interpretive bridges for moving from ontology to applied models.|
|Scaffolding for Future Models|Often act as conceptual precursors to detailed Model notes (e.g., Identity Loops, Field Structures).|
|Cross-Domain Integration|Ensure that expansions into new fields maintain structural consistency with foundational principles.|


## When to Add a Domain Reflection?

- When a domain-specific phenomenon is being **conceptually mapped through the lens of ∆‑Theory**.
    
- When you are formalizing a **structural pattern interpretation (e.g., Systems Feedback, Semantic Networks)** that’s not yet a concrete Model but needs theoretical reflection.
    
- When cross-domain parallels (e.g., between cognition and systems theory) need to be clarified conceptually before operationalizing in the Model layer.
