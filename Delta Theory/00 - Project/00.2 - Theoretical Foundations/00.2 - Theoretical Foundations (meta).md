# 00.2 – Theoretical Foundations

This note defines the **purpose and structural role** of the **Theoretical Foundations folder** in the ∆‑Theory Knowledge Base. It serves as the **conceptual root layer**, anchoring all meta-notes that establish the **core ontological principles, structural models, and reasoning architectures** of ∆‑Theory.

## Purpose of Theoretical Foundations

|Aspect|Description|
|---|---|
|Ontological Core|Defines Difference (∆) as the irreducible primitive of being.|
|Structural Geometry|Explains why Tetrahedral Closure is the minimal condition for stabilized structure.|
|Propagation Mechanics|Details how difference propagates, embeds, and stabilizes through recursive mechanisms.|
|Complexity Scaling|Outlines how structural complexity arises without adding ontological layers — through recursive embedding and stabilization dynamics.|

These notes are not operational specs or domain models. They function as **the axiomatic codebase** — **the structural logic that governs the entire Knowledge Base**.


## Role in the Knowledge Base Architecture

|Function|Why it Matters|
|---|---|
|Conceptual Anchor|Provides the ontological and philosophical basis for all structural entities in the project.|
|Structural Blueprint|Frames how difference propagates into Ontology, how Specs formalize it, and how Models instantiate it.|
|Scaling Logic|Establishes principles ensuring that as complexity scales, ontological minimalism is preserved.|
|Coherence Framework|Aligns all project expansions with core structural reasoning, preventing arbitrary conceptual bloat.|


## Navigation & Linking Context

- **Ontology, Spec, and Model layers** must link back to Theoretical Foundations to ensure **conceptual coherence**.
    
- Any **new conceptual modules** (e.g., Recursive Ontogenesis, Field Dynamics) should first be introduced here before formalizing in technical layers.
    
- This folder is dedicated to **structural clarity and foundational reasoning** — operational details (predicates, models, domain instances) are documented in their respective layers.
    
- It acts as the **meta-ontological compass** of the project.
