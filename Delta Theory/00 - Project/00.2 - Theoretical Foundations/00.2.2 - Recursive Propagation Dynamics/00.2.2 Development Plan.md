## Folder Name:

**00.2.2 – Recursive Propagation Dynamics**

## Folder Purpose:

This section will define how **difference propagates through recursive structuring**, forming stable and emergent configurations. It focuses on the **dynamics of recursive embedding, propagation tensions, feedback mechanisms, and structural modulations** that govern system behavior across scales.

---

## Key Themes to Cover:

|Theme|Explanation|
|---|---|
|Recursive Embedding Chains|How differences generate further differences through relational embedding (∆-chains).|
|Propagation Tension Modulation|Structural forces that modulate propagation speed, directionality, and stability (∆-tension, coherence fields).|
|Feedback Loops & Resonance|Self-referential structures that sustain or collapse difference propagation through feedback.|
|Collapse & Dissipation Mechanisms|How difference propagation can fail to stabilize, leading to collapse thresholds or dissipation.|
|Stabilization Dynamics|Recursive mechanisms (PhaseLock, ClosureStrength) that allow difference structures to persist.|
|Recursive Identity Formation|The process by which self-referential loops generate stable "identity patterns" within difference propagation fields.|

## Meta Note: 00.2.2 – Recursive Propagation Dynamics (meta).md

This overview note will:

- Define the scope and purpose of the Recursive Propagation Dynamics section.
    
- Explain how this layer serves as a **bridge between foundational principles and applied models (Specs, Ontologies, and Physics)**.
    
- Detail the **structural logic of recursive difference propagation as the driver of system dynamics**.
