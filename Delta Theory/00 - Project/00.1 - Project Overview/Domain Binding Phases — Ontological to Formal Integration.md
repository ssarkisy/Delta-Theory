# Binding Delta Theory to Domain — Phase Structuring Note

## Purpose

This note defines the **two-phase binding process** for integrating Delta Theory’s recursive ontology with any target domain (Physics, Cognition, Systems, Ethics, etc.). It distinguishes between **Phase 1 (Ontological Structural Binding)** and **Phase 2 (Mathematical & Empirical Formal Binding)**, outlining the purpose, outputs, and template expansions required for each phase.

## Phase 1 — Ontological Structural Binding

### Objective:

Establish a **fully traceable recursive structuring chain** for the domain model, ensuring every concept resolves through Delta Theory’s foundational scaffold.

### Key Deliverables:

|Deliverable|Description|
|---|---|
|Recursive Structuring Flow|Map Ontology → Property → Construct → Recursive Construct → Spec → Constant → Model.|
|Recursive Formal Expression|Define model’s recursive embedding and stabilization conditions via formal expressions (symbolic structure, not domain equations).|
|Constants Anchoring|Specify which structural constants stabilize recursive dynamics (π, h, ψA, etc.).|
|Classical ↔ Recursive Mapping|Interpret classical domain concepts through recursive structuring logic.|
|Failure Modes|Outline recursive collapse scenarios tied to propagation coherence and boundary destabilization.|

### Templates Used:

- **Ontology Note Template** — Primitives of structuring.
    
- **Property Note Template** — Modulation attributes.
    
- **Construct Note Template** — Functional synthesis.
    
- **Recursive Construct Note Template** — Feedback loops.
    
- **Spec Note Template** — Structural operational rules.
    
- **Constant Note Template** — Modulation invariants.
    
- **Model Note Template (v2.0)** — Domain-specific recursive realization.
    

### Status after Phase 1:

- Ontological consistency across notes.
    
- Domain model fully resolved through recursive structuring logic.
    
- Structural stabilization anchored by constants.
    
- High-level interpretive mappings to classical frameworks (without derivations).

## Phase 2 — Mathematical & Empirical Formal Binding

### Objective:

Formally derive **domain-level mathematical frameworks** and **observable predictive mappings** from Delta Theory’s recursive structures.

### Key Deliverables:

|Deliverable|Description|
|---|---|
|Mathematical Overlay Layer|Derive or reinterpret classical equations (e.g., Maxwell, Dirac) from recursive difference propagation mechanisms.|
|Empirical Observable Mappings|Link recursive structuring parameters (tension gradients, phase coherence, loop closure ratios) to measurable quantities (charge, mass, interaction cross-sections).|
|Simulation Scenario Mapping|Outline computational models that simulate recursive feedback dynamics reproducing empirical phenomena.|
|Predictive Correlates|Formulate testable predictions where Delta Theory offers novel insights or refinements to domain behavior.|

### Template Expansions Required:

|Template|Phase 2 Expansion|
|---|---|
|Model Note Template|Add section: **Mathematical Derivation Overlay** — Formal mapping of recursive structure to domain equations.|
|Model Note Template|Add section: **Empirical Parameter Mapping** — Difference structuring ↔ observable quantity relations (charge, mass, etc.).|
|Model Note Template|Add section: **Recursive Simulation Scenario** — Flow diagrams or pseudocode for simulating recursive feedback propagation.|
|Spec Note Template|Add field: **Domain Equation Mapping** — Classical equation overlay illustrating how Spec’s operational logic manifests empirically.|
|Constant Note Template|Add field: **Empirical Parameter Correlation** — Describe how the constant’s recursive function correlates with classical domain constants (e.g., elementary charge, fine-structure constant).|
|Recursive Construct Note Template|Add section: **Recursive Feedback Simulation Role** — How this loop’s dynamics translate into simulation components or empirical behaviors.|

## Structural Reasoning Rules for Phase 2

- Every mathematical overlay must preserve **Primitive Difference origin traceability**.
    
- Constants must act as **modulation invariants anchoring recursive stabilization**, not as empirical inputs.
    
- Recursive difference propagation must be formalized as **the generative mechanism for emergent domain equations**.
    
- Observable quantities should be expressed as **stabilized difference modulation amplitudes, frequencies, or loop closure ratios**.
    
- Feedback loops are the **primary agents of dynamic system behavior** — replace force carriers and interaction particles with recursive tension modulation pathways.
