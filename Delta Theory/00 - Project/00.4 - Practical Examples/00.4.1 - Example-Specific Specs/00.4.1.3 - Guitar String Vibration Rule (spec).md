# Guitar String Vibration Rule (spec)

## Definition

**`Guitar String Vibration Rule`** is a formal **embedding and modulation rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (string vibrations)** propagate through recursive embeddings (nodes, harmonics, body resonance) to generate stabilized forms (audible tones).

It governs:
- **Vibration patterns and their alignment with fixed boundary points (bridge, nut, frets)**.
- **Recursive propagation into harmonic overtones and body resonance**.
- **Stabilization of oscillations into coherent sound forms (notes)**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆`|Primitive Difference|Initial string disturbance (plucking, striking)|
|`R(∆)`|Relational Embedding|Boundary constraints — string length, tension, anchor points|
|`n`|Integer|Harmonic order (1st fundamental, 2nd overtone, etc.)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Result|Waveform|Stable standing wave pattern representing a specific tone or harmonic|
|Resonance|Bool|Indicates whether recursive embeddings (harmonics) stabilize or collapse|

## Formal Expression

Recursive Embedding Condition for Harmonics:
$$
F_n := R^n(∆) \quad \text{iff} \quad \lambda_n = \frac{2L}{n}
$$

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$∆$|Initial disturbance (plucking action)|
|$R^n(∆)$|n-th order recursive embedding (harmonic node embedding)|
|$F_n$|Resulting stabilized waveform (harmonic tone)|
|$L$|String length (fixed boundary condition)|
|$\lambda_n$|Wavelength of n-th harmonic|

Stabilization Condition:
$$
Resonance = True \quad \text{iff} \quad n \in ℕ \quad \land \quad F_n \text{ maintains phase coherence within boundary constraints}
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each harmonic_order in ℕ:
    calculate wavelength = 2 * string_length / harmonic_order
    if wavelength aligns with boundary nodes:
        propagate vibration (F_n forms)
    else:
        vibration collapses (no resonance)
````

## Preconditions

- String must be under tension between two fixed boundary points (bridge & nut/fret).
    
- Initial difference (∆) introduced through plucking, striking, or bowing.
    
- Recursive node placement (harmonic nodes) must align with boundary conditions for stable resonance.
    

## Postconditions

- If embedding succeeds, a stable standing wave is formed, producing a tone.
    
- Higher-order embeddings generate harmonic overtones, enriching the sound.
    
- Misaligned embeddings result in vibrational collapse (damping).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Governs **Recursive Embedding Constructs (ResonantPropagation)** through vibrational systems.
    
- Demonstrates how difference propagates into stabilized recursive structures via physical boundary constraints.
    
- Forms a foundational Spec for modeling recursive propagation in physical, cognitive, and informational systems.
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Guitar Performance|Player adjusts plucking position and pressure, influencing which harmonics are emphasized|
|Instrument Design|Bridge/nut/fret placements define relational embedding constraints|
|Resonant Systems|Applied in acoustics, optics (standing waves), cognitive resonance patterns (abstract analogies)|
