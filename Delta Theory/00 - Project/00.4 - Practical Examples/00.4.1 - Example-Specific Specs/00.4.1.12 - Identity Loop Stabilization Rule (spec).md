# IdentityLoopStabilizationRule (spec)

## Definition

**`IdentityLoopStabilizationRule`** is a formal **recursive feedback closure rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (subject-object distinctions, reflective acts)** propagate through **recursive self-referential embeddings**, stabilizing into a **persistent, coherent self-identity loop**.

It governs:
- **The recursive embedding of difference through layers of self-reflection**.
- **Feedback closure conditions that sustain identity coherence**.
- **Stability thresholds that maintain a persistent sense of self through recursive difference cycles**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_reflection`|Primitive Difference|Subject-object distinction or reflective act (e.g., “I see”, “I am aware of being aware”)|
|`EmbeddingContext`|RecursiveEmbedding|Cognitive relational structure embedding reflections (thoughts, memories, sensory feedback)|
|`FeedbackModulation`|StabilizationFeedback|Recursive feedback reinforcing or modulating self-coherence (e.g., attention focus, emotional tone)|
|`BoundaryConditions`|Spec|Constraints defining coherence thresholds (e.g., narrative consistency, sensory alignment)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|IdentityForm|Form|Stabilized recursive loop structure representing self-identity|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether recursive reflections maintain coherent self-referential closure|

## Stabilization Condition

Recursive Self-Reference Loop:
$$
F_{n} := ⊚(R^{n}(∆_{reflection})) \quad \text{iff} \quad Recursive Feedback \quad reinforces coherent self-reference patterns
$$

Stabilization occurs when:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Recursive Reflection Loop \quad maintains cognitive coherence within BoundaryConditions
$$

Destabilization Condition (e.g., Dissociation):
$$
Stabilization = False \quad \text{if} \quad Recursive Loop Feedback \quad becomes incoherent or disconnected (identity fragmentation)
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
initialize ∆_reflection (subject-object distinction)
embed ∆ through RecursiveEmbeddingContext (self-referential thoughts, feedback loops)
for each recursion step:
    apply FeedbackModulation (attention focus, emotional reinforcement)
    if loop closure maintains narrative coherence and boundary alignment:
        sustain IdentityForm (stable sense of “I”)
    else:
        destabilize loop (identity fragmentation, dissociation)
````

## Preconditions

- Initial reflective distinction (∆_reflection) is recognized (self-other boundary present).
    
- EmbeddingContext provides cognitive structures for recursive embedding (memory loops, reflective processes).
    
- BoundaryConditions define thresholds for coherence (e.g., sensory alignment, narrative consistency).
    

## Postconditions

- Successful recursive closure results in a **persistent IdentityForm** — a stable cognitive self-loop.
    
- Recursive feedback sustains identity as long as coherence thresholds are maintained.
    
- Destabilization may lead to identity diffusion, dissociation, or restructuring (e.g., in meditative states, trauma responses).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveStabilization Constructs** in cognitive systems.
    
- Models self-identity as an emergent structure of recursively stabilized difference reflections.
    
- Provides a formal scaffold for exploring identity formation, coherence, fluidity, and dissolution.
