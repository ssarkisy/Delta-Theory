# SemanticNetworkEmbeddingRule (spec)

## Definition

**`SemanticNetworkEmbeddingRule`** is a formal **embedding rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (conceptual distinctions, meanings)** are **recursively embedded into semantic networks**, forming coherent structures through relational linkages (associations, hierarchies, contextual embeddings).

It governs:
- **Propagation of difference through semantic relations (is-a, part-of, associated-with)**.
- **Embedding sequences that expand semantic contexts while preserving coherence**.
- **Stabilization conditions ensuring that network embeddings remain interpretable and contextually aligned**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_concept`|Primitive Difference|Distinct conceptual unit (e.g., "cat", "justice")|
|`EmbeddingRelation`|RelationalEmbedding|Semantic link type (synonymy, hypernymy, meronymy, associative link)|
|`ContextualNeighborhood`|Form|Local semantic context of related concepts|
|`EmbeddingPolicy`|Spec|Rule set defining relevance thresholds, contextual constraints, and link formation criteria|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|SemanticNetwork|Form|Expanded semantic graph with ∆ embedded into contextually coherent structure|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether the embedding preserves semantic coherence (avoiding noise, drift, or ambiguity explosion)|

## Embedding Condition

Recursive Semantic Embedding:
$$
Context_{n} := R^{n}(∆_{concept}) \quad \text{iff} \quad ∆_{concept} \quad aligns with EmbeddingPolicy constraints within ContextualNeighborhood
$$

Stabilization occurs when:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad SemanticNetwork \quad maintains interpretability, relevance, and structural coherence post-embedding
$$

Destabilization Condition (Semantic Noise):
$$
Stabilization = False \quad \text{if} \quad Embedding overextends context relevance, causing semantic drift or fragmentation
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆_concept to embed:
    identify EmbeddingRelation candidates in ContextualNeighborhood
    if EmbeddingPolicy criteria (relevance, context fit) met:
        embed ∆_concept via selected EmbeddingRelation
    else:
        reject embedding (maintain network coherence)
    evaluate overall SemanticNetwork coherence post-embedding (Stabilization check)
````

## Preconditions

- ∆_concept is a distinct, meaningful unit ready for relational embedding.
    
- ContextualNeighborhood provides sufficient anchoring nodes (existing concepts) for meaningful embedding.
    
- EmbeddingPolicy defines thresholds for semantic relevance, avoiding over-connection or drift.
    

## Postconditions

- Successfully embedded ∆ expands the semantic network while preserving contextual coherence.
    
- Recursive embeddings can form larger conceptual structures (topic clusters, ontological hierarchies).
    
- Failed embeddings (irrelevant, noisy) are rejected to preserve semantic network integrity.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveEmbedding Constructs** in conceptual systems.
    
- Demonstrates how meaning emerges through structured difference propagation, not isolated term definitions.
    
- Provides a framework for recursive semantic network expansion in linguistics, AI knowledge systems, and cognitive models.
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Linguistics|Building semantic fields and lexicons through relational embedding of word meanings|
|Knowledge Graphs|Structuring AI ontologies by embedding concepts via controlled relations|
|Cognitive Science|Modeling conceptual networks in human cognition through recursive difference embeddings|
