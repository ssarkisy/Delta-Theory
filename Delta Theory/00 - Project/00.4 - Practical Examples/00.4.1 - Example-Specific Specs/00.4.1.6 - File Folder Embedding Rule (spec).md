# File Folder Embedding Rule (spec)

## Definition

**`File Folder Embedding Rule`** is a formal **embedding rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (files and folders)** are structured into **recursive hierarchical systems (folder trees)** through consistent relational embedding and stabilization checks.

It governs:
- **Embedding sequences (parent → child relations)**.
- **Alignment and containment constraints (folders contain files/folders)**.
- **Structural coherence ensuring navigability and organizational integrity**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆`|Primitive Difference|File or folder to be embedded|
|`Fⱼ₋₁`|Form|Current folder structure before embedding|
|`EmbeddingDepth`|Integer|Current recursion level (root = 0, subfolder levels incrementally deeper)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Fⱼ|Form|Updated folder structure with ∆ embedded|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether embedding preserves organizational coherence|

## Embedding Condition

$$
Fⱼ := Fⱼ₋₁ + ∆ \quad \text{iff} \quad ∆ \text{ is embedded respecting parent-child containment constraints and depth limits}
$$

Recursive Embedding Sequence:
$$
RootFolder \rightarrow Subfolder₁ \rightarrow Subfolder₂ \rightarrow File
$$

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$∆$|File or folder to embed|
|$Fⱼ$|Resulting folder structure after embedding|
|EmbeddingDepth|Level of recursion within the folder hierarchy|

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆ in files_and_folders:
    if ∆ can be logically contained within Fⱼ₋₁ (parent folder):
        embed ∆ into current folder structure (Fⱼ)
    else:
        reject embedding (structural coherence broken)
````

## Preconditions

- Parent folder (Fⱼ₋₁) exists and is stable.
    
- Embedding sequence respects containment logic (folders contain files or subfolders).
    
- Optional constraints like **maximum embedding depth** or **naming conventions** may apply.
    

## Postconditions

- The folder structure remains **navigable, coherent, and logically organized**.
    
- Recursive embeddings extend structural depth while preserving traceability.
    
- Violations of embedding constraints (e.g., circular references, orphaned files) destabilize structure.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveEmbedding Constructs** in digital systems.
    
- Demonstrates how difference propagates into structured hierarchies through recursive embedding patterns.
    
- Prepares conceptual transition to more abstract recursive data structures (e.g., Git trees, Knowledge Graphs).
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Digital File Systems|User embeds files/folders into logical parent folders, creating navigable hierarchies|
|Software Projects|Organizing code modules within nested directories|
|Knowledge Organization|Building information taxonomies through recursive category embeddings|
