# LEGO Tower Embedding Rule (spec)

## Definition

**`LEGO Tower Embedding Rule`** is a formal **embedding rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (LEGO bricks)** are **aligned, stacked, and stabilized** to form a coherent vertical structure in the **LEGO Tower Example**.

It governs:
- **Placement alignment (brick-on-brick connectivity)**
- **Sequence of stacking actions**
- **Stabilization condition after each embedding step**

This Spec ensures that the **difference propagation** (adding bricks) maintains the integrity of the emergent Form (the tower).

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆`|Primitive Difference|Individual LEGO brick|
|`Fⱼ₋₁`|Form|Current tower structure before embedding|
|`Alignment`|Spatial Constraint|Defines surface-to-surface connection orientation (studs to sockets)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Result|Bool|Indicates whether the brick was embedded successfully, preserving tower stability|

## Formal Expression

Embedding Condition:
$$
Fⱼ := Fⱼ₋₁ + ∆ ⟺ ∆ \text{ is aligned with studs-to-sockets connection and stack axis is vertical}
$$

Recursive Stacking Sequence:
$$
Fₙ := Fₙ₋₁ + ∆ₙ \quad \text{iff Alignment(∆ₙ, Fₙ₋₁) = True}
$$

|Symbol|Meaning|
|---|---|
|$∆$|LEGO brick being added|
|$Fⱼ₋₁$|Tower state before current embedding|
|$Fⱼ$|Resulting tower state after embedding|
|Alignment|Spatial check ensuring correct surface connection|

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
for each ∆ in brick_stack_sequence:
    if ∆ studs align with previous brick sockets and stack remains vertical:
        embed ∆ onto tower
    else:
        reject embedding (structure destabilizes)
````

## Preconditions

- `∆` must have a compatible connection surface (studs/sockets).
    
- The current tower (`Fⱼ₋₁`) must be stable.
    
- Alignment orientation must preserve a vertical stack axis.
    

## Postconditions

- If embedding succeeds, the tower extends by one brick.
    
- If embedding fails (misalignment, tilting), structural coherence is broken, and the tower is unstable.
    
- Successful sequences recursively build coherent vertical Forms (Fₙ).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Defines a **specific embedding rule** for structured difference propagation in a tactile system.
    
- Acts as a **concrete Spec layer** linking PrimitiveDifference → Construct → Model.
    
- Serves as a teaching tool for understanding embedding constraints and stabilization checks.
    
- Scales conceptually into more complex recursive embedding structures (e.g., architectural load-bearing systems).
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|LEGO Tower Assembly|Aligning each brick precisely on top of the previous, pressing to lock studs/sockets|
|Structural Design Teaching|Demonstrates how simple alignment constraints enforce structural coherence|
|Systems Architecture (metaphorically)|Shows how embedding rules prevent architectural collapse in layered systems|
