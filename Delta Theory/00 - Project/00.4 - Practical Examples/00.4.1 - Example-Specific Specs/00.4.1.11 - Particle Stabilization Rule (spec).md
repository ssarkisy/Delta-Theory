# ParticleStabilizationRule (spec)

## Definition

**`ParticleStabilizationRule`** is a formal **recursive closure rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (energy/mass anomalies)** propagate through **recursive embeddings**, forming **feedback loops** that stabilize into **persistent, localized structures (particles)**.

It governs:
- **Recursive embedding of difference into field loops**.
- **Closure conditions ensuring the difference loop stabilizes into a coherent, self-sustaining form**.
- **Structural persistence constraints defining particle identity and stability thresholds**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_seed`|Primitive Difference|Localized energy/mass discontinuity initiating the recursive embedding|
|`EmbeddingLoop`|RecursiveEmbedding|Relational structure through which difference propagates (field loop path)|
|`StabilizationFeedback`|FeedbackStabilization|Recursive feedback reinforcing or modulating loop coherence|
|`BoundaryConditions`|Spec|Contextual constraints (e.g., conservation laws, field parameters)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|ParticleForm|Form|Stabilized difference loop representing a coherent particle structure|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether recursive embeddings successfully close into a stable configuration|

## Stabilization Condition

Recursive Loop Closure:
$$
F_{n} := ⊚(R^{n}(∆_{seed})) \quad \text{iff} \quad Loop_{Feedback} \quad reinforces ∆_{seed} \quad \text {maintaining phase coherence}
$$

Stabilization occurs when:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Loop_{Closure} \quad satisfies BoundaryConditions \quad \land \quad Recursive Feedback \quad sustains Form persistence
$$

Recursive Breakdown (Decay Condition):
$$
Stabilization = False \quad \text{if} \quad Feedback Damping \quad exceeds ∆_{seed} sustaining threshold
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
initialize ∆_seed (localized difference anomaly)
embed ∆ through recursive EmbeddingLoop paths
for each recursion step:
    apply StabilizationFeedback (phase coherence check)
    if LoopClosure condition met within BoundaryConditions:
        form ParticleForm (stabilized structure)
        exit recursion (stable particle)
    if feedback damping exceeds sustaining threshold:
        structure decays (particle destabilizes)
````

## Preconditions

- Initial Primitive Difference (∆_seed) must exceed minimum stabilization threshold (energy, mass density).
    
- Embedding loops are defined through field relations (curvature, flux pathways).
    
- BoundaryConditions set constraints (e.g., conservation of energy, quantization conditions).
    

## Postconditions

- Successful loop closure results in a **ParticleForm** — a stabilized recursive difference structure.
    
- Recursive feedback continues to sustain the particle’s existence unless disrupted by external interactions or internal feedback breakdown.
    
- Failure to meet stabilization criteria results in structural collapse (particle decay, transformation).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveStabilization Constructs** at the ontological level of particle formation.
    
- Demonstrates how **difference becomes persistently embedded through recursive feedback closure**.
    
- Provides a scalable model for understanding **particle identity, stability, and decay as functions of recursive difference loop dynamics**.
