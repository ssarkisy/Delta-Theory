# IdeaStabilizationRule (spec)

## Definition

**`IdeaStabilizationRule`** is a formal **recursive feedback closure rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (conceptual distinctions, perceptual anomalies)** propagate through **recursive embeddings** within a cognitive-semantic field, stabilizing into a **persistent, coherent Idea**.

It governs:
- **Recursive propagation of difference through semantic and reflective layers**.
- **Stabilization thresholds defining when an Idea achieves cognitive coherence**.
- **Feedback modulation loops that reinforce or disrupt the stability of emergent Ideas**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_spark`|Primitive Difference|Initial perceptual distinction or conceptual separation (the "seed" of the Idea)|
|`SemanticEmbedding`|RecursiveEmbedding|Relational structuring of the difference into conceptual networks (associations, analogies)|
|`ReflectiveFeedback`|StabilizationFeedback|Recursive cognitive feedback loops reinforcing or modulating Idea coherence|
|`BoundaryConditions`|Spec|Contextual constraints ensuring relevance, salience, and coherence of the Idea (e.g., attention focus, emotional resonance)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|IdeaForm|Form|Stabilized cognitive structure representing a coherent Idea|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether recursive difference embeddings have achieved coherence|

## Stabilization Condition

Recursive Idea Closure:
$$
F_{n} := ⊚(R^{n}(∆_{spark})) \quad \text{iff} \quad Recursive Feedback \quad maintains coherence across semantic embeddings
$$

Stabilization occurs when:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Recursive Reflections \quad align with BoundaryConditions (relevance, salience, coherence)
$$

Destabilization Condition (Idea Dissolution):
$$
Stabilization = False \quad \text{if} \quad Feedback Loops \quad lose coherence, leading to Idea fragmentation or drift
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
initialize ∆_spark (perceptual/conceptual anomaly)
embed ∆ recursively through SemanticEmbedding structures (associations, analogies)
for each recursion:
    apply ReflectiveFeedback (internal reflection, emotional salience)
    if loop closure maintains cognitive coherence (BoundaryConditions met):
        stabilize as IdeaForm (persistent thought structure)
    else:
        destabilize (Idea dissolves or fragments)
````

## Preconditions

- Initial ∆_spark is a recognized distinction (anomaly, insight, contrast).
    
- SemanticEmbedding context exists (network of related concepts, memories, associations).
    
- BoundaryConditions are defined (context relevance, emotional or attentional thresholds).
    

## Postconditions

- Successful stabilization results in a persistent **IdeaForm** — a coherent thought structure.
    
- Recursive feedback sustains the Idea’s presence within cognitive processes (working memory, conceptual space).
    
- Failure to stabilize leads to Idea dissipation (forgetting, loss of coherence) or transformation into a new Idea (conceptual drift).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveStabilization Constructs** at the level of cognitive Idea formation.
    
- Models Idea emergence as a dynamic recursive structure of difference propagation and feedback coherence.
    
- Bridges ∆‑Theory into cognitive science, creativity models, and AI conceptual formation mechanisms.
