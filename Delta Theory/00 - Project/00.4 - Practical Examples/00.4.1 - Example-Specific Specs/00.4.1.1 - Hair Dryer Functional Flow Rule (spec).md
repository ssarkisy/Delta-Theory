# HairDryerFunctionalFlowRule (spec)

## Definition

**`HairDryerFunctionalFlowRule`** is a formal **operational rule** that defines **how Primitive Differences (mechanical motion, heat)** propagate through the structured components of a **hair dryer** to produce a functional output — a directed stream of hot air.

It governs:
- **Sequential activation of components (fan, heater)**.
- **Flow propagation through structured pathways (air ducts)**.
- **Stabilization checks ensuring coherent airflow output**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_fan`|Primitive Difference|Rotational motion generated by fan motor activation|
|`∆_heat`|Primitive Difference|Thermal difference generated by the heating element|
|`FlowPath`|Relational Embedding|Structured air pathway through the hair dryer components|
|`ControlState`|Switch|On/Off input from user to activate/deactivate functional flow|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|Airflow|Directed Flow|Coherent stream of air (hot or cold) exiting the device|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether functional flow remains coherent and safe|

## Flow Sequence Condition

$$
Airflow = ControlState_{on} \quad \Rightarrow \quad ∆_{fan} \rightarrow FlowPath \rightarrow ∆_{heat} \quad \Rightarrow \quad Output
$$

- If `ControlState = Off` → No flow (system idle).
- If `ControlState = On` → Flow is initiated via fan; heating is optionally embedded into the flow.

Stabilization Condition:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Airflow_{output} \quad \text{is continuous, directional, and within safe operational parameters}
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
if ControlState == ON:
    activate fan (∆_fan)
    propagate airflow through FlowPath
    if HeatMode == ON:
        activate heater (∆_heat)
        embed thermal difference into airflow
    ensure output airflow is coherent and stable
else:
    system remains idle (no airflow)
````

## Preconditions

- Physical components (fan, heater, ducts) are structurally intact.
    
- ControlState is actively set by user.
    
- FlowPath alignment ensures unobstructed air passage.
    

## Postconditions

- Successful flow propagation results in directed (hot/cold) air stream.
    
- Structural or activation failures disrupt flow coherence.
    
- Continuous stabilization loop monitors for operational integrity.
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Demonstrates **DifferencePropagation Constructs** within flow-based physical systems.
    
- Clarifies how difference is **sequentially embedded and modulated through system architecture**.
    
- Provides a tangible example of operational Specs governing structural difference flows.
    
- Serves as a pedagogical anchor for more abstract flow-based systems (fluid dynamics, information streams).
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Hair Dryer Operation|User activates fan/heater, producing functional airflow output|
|HVAC Systems|Propagating airflow through duct networks with heating/cooling modulation|
|System Design|Simplified model of sequential difference propagation in functional architectures|
