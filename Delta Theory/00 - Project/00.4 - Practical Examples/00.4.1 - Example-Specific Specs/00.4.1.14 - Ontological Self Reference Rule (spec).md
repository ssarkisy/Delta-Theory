# OntologicalSelfReferenceRule (spec)

## Definition

**`OntologicalSelfReferenceRule`** is a formal **recursive closure rule** that defines how **Primitive Differences (being/non-being distinctions)** propagate through **self-referential embeddings**, stabilizing into **persistent ontological structures ("worlds", realities)**.

It governs:
- **Recursive embedding of ontological distinctions through self-referential modeling layers**.
- **Closure conditions ensuring that recursive embeddings stabilize into a coherent ontological loop**.
- **Persistence criteria defining stable ontological configurations capable of self-modeling coherence**.

## Inputs

|Input|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`∆_being`|Primitive Difference|Ontological distinction (being vs non-being, existence vs non-existence)|
|`EmbeddingLayer`|RecursiveEmbedding|Layered contextual modeling structures (e.g., “this appears within that”)|
|`ReflectiveFeedback`|StabilizationFeedback|Recursive feedback reinforcing or modulating ontological coherence|
|`BoundaryConditions`|Spec|Constraints defining ontological coherence (e.g., logical consistency, appearance stability)|

## Output

|Output|Type|Meaning|
|---|---|---|
|OntologyForm|Form|Stabilized self-referential ontological loop structure (a “world-loop”)|
|Stabilization|Bool|Indicates whether recursive modeling loops close into a coherent ontological structure|

## Stabilization Condition

Recursive Ontological Loop Closure:
$$
F_{n} := ⊚(R^{n}(∆_{being})) \quad \text{iff} \quad Recursive Feedback \quad sustains ontological coherence across modeling layers
$$

Stabilization occurs when:
$$
Stabilization = True \quad \text{iff} \quad Self-Reference Loop \quad aligns with BoundaryConditions \quad and maintains reflexive closure
$$

Destabilization (Ontological Collapse):
$$
Stabilization = False \quad \text{if} \quad Recursive Feedback \quad loses coherence, leading to ontological dissolution (paradox, fragmentation)
$$

## Interpretive Pseudocode

```pseudo
initialize ∆_being (distinction of existence)
embed ∆ recursively through EmbeddingLayer contexts (self-modeling reflections)
for each recursion:
    apply ReflectiveFeedback (coherence alignment)
    if loop closure aligns with BoundaryConditions (logical, phenomenological coherence):
        sustain OntologyForm (stable reality loop)
    else:
        destabilize (ontological paradox, incoherence)
````

## Preconditions

- Primitive Difference (∆_being) must initiate an act of ontological distinction (separation of appearance from non-appearance).
    
- EmbeddingLayer must provide contextual structures for recursive embedding (e.g., “world modeling world” relations).
    
- BoundaryConditions define coherence criteria (logical consistency, phenomenological alignment).
    

## Postconditions

- Successful recursive closure forms a **OntologyForm** — a stable ontological loop where reality models itself coherently.
    
- Continuous ReflectiveFeedback sustains the structure against external perturbations or internal logical tensions.
    
- Destabilization (e.g., paradoxes, self-reference breakdowns) can lead to loop dissolution or transition into alternate stabilization states (ontological phase shifts).
    

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- Operationalizes **RecursiveStabilization Constructs** at the ontological modeling level.
    
- Models reality not as a foundational given but as an emergent recursive loop of self-referential difference propagation.
    
- Bridges metaphysical self-reference (ontology modeling itself) with ∆-Theory’s structured difference flow.
    

## Example Usage

|Context|Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Philosophy of Being|Understanding reality as a recursively stabilized structure of ontological self-reference|
|Metaphysics|Modeling self-reflective ontologies (e.g., observer-dependent realities, world-in-world recursion)|
|Systems Theory|Mapping recursive modeling loops in cognitive systems, simulation architectures, or AI meta-modeling|
