# Resonant Band — Stable Corridor of ∆

## Explanation / Definition

A **Resonant Band** is a **coherent region within a ∆‑Field** where recursive difference embeddings (`Rⁿ(∆₀)`) can stabilize due to resonance between internal dynamics and the field substrate.

It functions as a **corridor of persistent recursion** — a zone in which the stabilization operator `⊚` repeatedly holds across levels of embedding, enabling form to persist.

> The Resonant Band is **where ∆-paths are most likely to stabilize**, and where collapse thresholds are not crossed.

---

## Formal Expression

Let:
- `Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)` be a recursively embedded form
- `⊚(Fₙ)` evaluate to 1 (true) if the structure is stable
- `⊚Field(x)` modulate local stabilizability
- `Resonance(Pₙ)` measure phase coherence across the path

Then:

```

ResonantBand = { x ∈ ∆‑Field | ⊚Field(x) × Resonance(Pₙ) ≥ θ }

```

Where:
- `θ` = stabilization threshold
- The band is defined by zones of high internal + external support

## Functional Characteristics

| Feature              | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| **Spatially localized** | Exists within bounded ∆-zones (not the whole field) |
| **Recursively coherent** | Forms within maintain internal structure across layers |
| **Collapse-buffering** | Resistant to breakdown due to alignment and memory |
| **Threshold-dependent** | Only forms above a certain resonance can enter |
| **Semi-stable** | Not eternally fixed — bands may shift, decay, or phase-lock |

---

## Interpretive Notes

- Resonant Bands are **ontological attractors** for form: where Rⁿ(∆₀) “wants” to stabilize.
- Outside the band, even valid embeddings may fail to hold (`⊚ → 0`).
- Analogous to:
  - **energy wells** in physics,
  - **habitable zones** in planetary systems,
  - **attractor basins** in dynamical systems.
- In consciousness models, Resonant Bands may correspond to **stable modes of self**, **working memory zones**, or **active thought patterns**.
