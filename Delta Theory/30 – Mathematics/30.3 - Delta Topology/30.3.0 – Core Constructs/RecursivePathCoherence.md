# Resonance(Pₙ) — Recursive Path Coherence

## Explanation / Definition

**`Resonance(Pₙ)`** is a measure of the **recursive coherence and alignment** of a ∆‑Path:

> `Pₙ = [∆₀, R(∆₀), R²(∆₀), ..., Rⁿ(∆₀)]`

It quantifies how well the stages of recursive embedding **reinforce each other** rather than interfere destructively. It acts as a scalar indicator of **whether a path tends toward stabilization or collapse**.

This is the **cumulative recursive analog** of local `∆‑Resonance`.

---

## Formal Expression (Sketch)

Let:
- `∆‑Resonance(∆ᵢ, ∆ᵢ₊₁)` = local resonance at step `i`
- `τ(i)` = phase alignment coefficient at level `i` (see `τ(x)` in calculus)
- `M(i)` = structural memory retained from earlier forms
- `⊚Field(xᵢ)` = field modulation at point `xᵢ` in the path

Then:

$Resonance(Pₙ) ≈ ∑ᵢ=₀ⁿ wᵢ × [∆‑Resonance(∆ᵢ, ∆ᵢ₊₁) × τ(i) × M(i) × ⊚Field(xᵢ)]$

Where `wᵢ` are weighting factors (optional, e.g. recency bias).

## Functional Characteristics

| Feature               | Description |
|-----------------------|-------------|
| **Scalar**            | Outputs a single-valued metric per path |
| **Recursive-aware**   | Sensitive to alignment across R-layers |
| **Collapse-predictive** | Low values signal likely breakdown |
| **Stabilization-linked** | High values correlate with sustained forms |
| **Multifactorial**    | Depends on dynamics, memory, field, and feedback |

---

## Interpretive Notes

- Think of `Resonance(Pₙ)` as a **"structural signal-to-noise ratio"** across recursive embedding.
- High resonance → self-reinforcing ∆‑structures (e.g., stable thought loops, particle identities, identity attractors).
- Low resonance → destructive interference, leading to collapse or disintegration.
- Serves as a **hidden driver** of why forms stabilize in some fields but not others.

## Usage

- Used to:
  - Evaluate whether a form is in a [[ResonantBand]]
  - Diagnose risk of [[FormCollapse]]
  - Model coherence in cognitive systems or physical fields
- Potential threshold: `Resonance(Pₙ) ≥ θ` → stable form
