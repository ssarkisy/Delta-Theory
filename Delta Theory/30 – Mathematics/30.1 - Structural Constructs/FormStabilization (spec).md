# stabilize(Fⱼ)

## Definition

**`stabilize(Fⱼ)`** is the operation by which a **form `Fⱼ` regains coherence**, provided that the underlying difference `∆ⱼ` has been successfully **restored and stabilized**.

It reflects the re-establishment of a valid recursive structure anchored in ontological distinction.

---

## Formal Condition

> `Fⱼ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ⊚(R(∆ⱼ))`

This means a form `Fⱼ` belongs to the set of **StableForms** if and only if the difference `∆ⱼ` is:

1. **Relationally wrapped** (`R(∆ⱼ)`)
2. **Ontologically stabilized** (`⊚(...)`)

---

## Role in Theory

* Acts as the **gatekeeper** for form re-coherence.
* Used in defining:

  * Stability conditions across levels
  * Restoration chains (`restore(∆ⱼ) ⇒ stabilize(Fⱼ)`)
  * Membership in `StableForms` vs `ApparentForms`

---

## Use in Theoretical Constructs

* Core to the **recursive reconstruction logic** in:

  * Corollary 5: Principle of Asymmetric Restoration
  * Theorem of Cascading Destabilization
* Appears in meta-axioms:

  > `F = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`
  > `Fₙ ∈ StableForms ⇔ ∀ k ∈ [0, n]: ⊚(Rᵏ(∆₀))`

---

## Interpretation

* A form is **not stable** just because it appears structured.
* It is stable **only** if the difference that defines it has been:

  * Reintroduced (`restore(∆ⱼ)`)
  * Stabilized (`⊚(R(∆ⱼ))`)
* If this condition fails, the form is classified as `Apparent` or `Collapsed`.
