# Coherence(Fₙ)

## Explanation / Definition

**`Coherence(Fₙ)`** measures the **internal consistency**, **resonant alignment**, and **structural unity** of a form `Fₙ = ⊚(Rⁿ(∆₀))`. It reflects how well the relational components of the form **reinforce each other**, maintaining their configuration as a whole.

> A form is **coherent** when its ∆‑components align across recursive levels, resonate without destructive interference, and maintain closure under pressure.

---

## Formal Interpretation

Let `Fₙ` be a stabilized recursive form. Then:

```math
Coherence(Fₙ) ∝ PathPersistence(Rⁿ) × ClosureStrength(Fₙ) × FeedbackAlignment
````

Where:

- **PathPersistence(Rⁿ)** — How long the recursive embedding holds
    
- **ClosureStrength(Fₙ)** — How tightly the form loops on itself
    
- **FeedbackAlignment** — How harmoniously feedback from one layer supports another
    

A coherent form:

- Resists collapse
    
- Enables transmission across fields
    
- Can interact stably with other forms

## Core Properties

|Property|Description|
|---|---|
|Recursive Harmony|Nested ∆‑structures remain in phase|
|Stability Indicator|High coherence → low susceptibility to perturbation|
|Structural Unity|Appears as a “whole” rather than a fragmented configuration|
|Resonant Integrity|Supports internal reinforcement of meaning / identity|

## Role in ∆‑Theory

- **Central metric** for distinguishing StableForms from PseudoForms
    
- Basis for modeling **mass**, **memory**, **identity**, and **longevity**
    
- Determines which forms can act as **agents**, **particles**, or **patterns**

## Usage

## Examples / Case Studies

|Form Type|Coherence(Fₙ) Interpretation|
|---|---|
|Photon|Minimal coherence, shallow path — fast propagation|
|Proton|Deep recursive coherence — stable mass-holding loop|
|Memory|Coherent loop trace across time — resistant to overwriting|
|Social myth|Shared pattern held across agents — collective coherence|

## Open Directions

- Formalize `Coherence(Fₙ)` as a function over ∆‑Topologies
    
- Connect with entropy: coherence as ∆‑ordering across time
    
- Define coherence thresholds for **form birth / collapse**
