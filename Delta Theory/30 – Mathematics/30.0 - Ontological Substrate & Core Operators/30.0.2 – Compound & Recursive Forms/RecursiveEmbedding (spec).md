# Rⁿ(∆) – Recursive Embedding

## Explanation / Definition

`Rⁿ(∆)` refers to the **recursive application of relational wrapping** around any difference `∆`, not necessarily primitive.

Unlike `Rⁿ(∆₀)` — which embeds the **initial ontological difference** and defines the core hierarchy of forms — `Rⁿ(∆)` generalizes the process to:

- Restored or disturbed differences
- Contextual differences arising in the ∆‑field
- Non-axiomatic layers (e.g. environmental modulation)

This operator forms the backbone of **recursive propagation**, **stabilization chains**, and **field-driven emergence**.

---

## Formulaic Structure

Given any difference `∆` (not necessarily ∆₀), we define:

$R⁰(∆) = ∆ R¹(∆) = R(∆) Rⁿ(∆) = R(Rⁿ⁻¹(∆))$

This recursive structure allows `∆` to **echo** and **reformulate** itself across layers, whether as part of:

- Dynamic stabilization
- Memory propagation
- Field responses
- ∆-loops from derived or emergent states

|--------------------------|----------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Origin                   | Primitive ontological difference | Any structured or emergent ∆      |
| Role in theory           | Axiomatic foundation             | Generalized recursion dynamics    |
| Typical use              | Defining stable forms (`Fₙ`)     | Collapse / restore / modulate     |
| Stability conditions     | Central                          | Contextual                        |

## Usage

- Defines recursive patterns in **non-axiomatic layers**
- Enables **reactive** or **adaptive** relational chains
- Appears in dynamic processes:

  * `restore(∆ⱼ) → Rⁿ(∆ⱼ)`
  * `collapse(Fⱼ) → failure of Rⁿ(∆ⱼ)`
  * `⊚(Rⁿ(∆))` as **secondary coherence test**
