# ∆‑Field

## Explanation / Definition

The **∆‑Field** is the **fundamental ontological substrate** in the FRONT framework — a **fractal, relational medium** in which all differences (`∆`) emerge, propagate, and interact.

Unlike classical fields defined by spatial metrics or scalar/vector quantities, the ∆‑Field is a **field of structured difference**. It is not a container, but a **relational potentiality** — the condition that makes all form, force, and interaction possible.

> The ∆‑Field is the **ground of becoming**: the background tension from which all stabilized relational forms (`Fₙ`) arise.

## Formal View

Let `∆` denote a primitive difference.

Then the ∆‑Field is:

> A space of possible configurations: `Rⁿ(∆₀)`  
> Where difference structures propagate and resonate

Its **modulations** give rise to:

- Relational deformations (`R′ ≠ R`)
- Emergent forms (`Fₙ = Rⁿ(∆₀)`)
- Energy modes (via ∂Fₙ / ∂t or stored tension)

## Dependencies

- [[PrimitiveDifference]] — fundamental unit
- [[RelationalEmbedding]] — relational embedding
- [[RecursiveFormIdentity]] — structured form from difference
- [[DeltaFlux]] — continuous transformation in the field
- [[StabilityConditions]] — defines when local ∆‑patterns stabilize

## Usage

- **Foundation** for all physical, cognitive, and informational fields
- Supports **nonlocal coherence** (e.g. in `[[Entanglement]]`)
- Models **propagation**, **resonance**, and **emergence** in all domains
- Explains how seemingly disconnected forms **relate via shared difference**
