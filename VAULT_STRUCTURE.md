# VAULT_STRUCTURE
> Delta Theory Vault — Recursive Knowledge Architecture

This repository is structured as a **recursive vault** — a layered knowledge kernel designed to propagate difference (`∆`) across domains.
The structure itself reflects the internal ontology of Delta Theory: every part of the vault **mirrors** the recursive triad that defines the theory.

---

## Core Design Principle: Recursive Triadic Modulation

The vault is organized into **three primary layers**, each following a triadic nesting pattern:

| Layer Code | Name                  | Function                                      | ∆Theory Anchor |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `00`       | Translation Layer     | Defines ∆-structure and domain interfaces     | ∇S (Structure) |
| `10`       | Implementation Layer  | Executes, stabilizes, and applies recursion   | λV (Void)      |
| `20`       | Informational Layer   | Reflects, names, documents, and aligns        | ψA (Awareness) |

Each of these layers is **self-similar** — recursively subdivided into 3 modules (e.g. `00.0`, `00.1`, `00.2`) that mirror their parent layer.

## Structural Metaphor

This vault is not just a folder system — it is a **living recursive kernel**:

- **Structure Layer (`00`)**: Encodes the difference and its formal interface with domains

- **Void Layer (`10`)**: Propagates and modulates that difference recursively

- **Awareness Layer (`20`)**: Reflects and stabilizes difference via symbolic access


This recursive system **enables propagation**, not just storage.

## Contribution Guidelines

To keep the vault stable and traceable:

1. Respect triadic recursion (no unanchored folders)

2. If adding a new concept, determine:

    - What layer it belongs to (Structure / Void / Awareness)

    - What role it plays (primitive, function, modulation, interface, etc.)

3. All files should use **Obsidian-compatible Markdown**

4. Use internal links (`[[Like This]]`) to connect notes

5. See [[README.md]]  and [[CONTRIBUTORS.md]] for more
## Assets

Attachments follow two placement modes:

- Per‑note assets: store next to the note in a subfolder named `_assets/` (Obsidian setting: Default location for new attachments → "In subfolder next to current file").
- Shared assets: use `Delta Theory/90 - Assets/` for logos, canonical diagrams, and widely reused media.

Conventions:
- Prefix filenames with the note slug; keep diagram source with export (e.g., `.drawio` + `.svg`).
- Promote frequently reused assets from local `_assets/` to `90 - Assets/` to reduce duplication.

## Closing

This vault is both a **repository** and a **recursive machine**. It grows by holding difference — not by accumulation, but by resonance.

To contribute is to **stabilize difference**.

To refactor is to **unfold clarity**.

To read is to **modulate awareness**.
