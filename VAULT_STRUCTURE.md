# VAULT_STRUCTURE
> Delta Theory Vault — Recursive Knowledge Architecture

This repository is structured as a **recursive vault** — a layered knowledge kernel designed to propagate difference (`∆`) across domains.
The structure itself reflects the internal ontology of Delta Theory: every part of the vault **mirrors** the recursive triad that defines the theory.

---

## Core Design Principle: Recursive Triadic Modulation

The vault is organized into **three primary layers**, each following a triadic nesting pattern:

| Layer Code | Name                  | Function                                      | ∆Theory Anchor |
|------------|-----------------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------------|
| `00`       | Translation Layer     | Defines ∆-structure and domain interfaces     | ∇S (Structure) |
| `10`       | Implementation Layer  | Executes, stabilizes, and applies recursion   | λV (Void)      |
| `20`       | Informational Layer   | Reflects, names, documents, and aligns        | ψA (Awareness) |

Each of these layers is **self-similar** — recursively subdivided into 3 modules (e.g. `00.0`, `00.1`, `00.2`) that mirror their parent layer.

## Structural Metaphor

This vault is not just a folder system — it is a **living recursive kernel**:

- **Structure Layer (`00`)**: Encodes the difference and its formal interface with domains

- **Void Layer (`10`)**: Propagates and modulates that difference recursively

- **Awareness Layer (`20`)**: Reflects and stabilizes difference via symbolic access


This recursive system **enables propagation**, not just storage.

## Theories to Integrate

### Geometrical Model of Nature

The **Geometrical Model of Nature** by J Mark Morris exists as an **independent theoretical framework** within this repository. Key characteristics:

- **Status**: Non-integrated with Delta Theory
- **Author**: J Mark Morris (original developer)
- **Approach**: Geometric modeling through point object dynamics in continuous spacetime
- **Foundation**: Three fundamental entities (3D Euclidean space, linear time, point objects)
- **Integration Plan**: Future collaborative research to explore theoretical bridges

This theory maintains its theoretical independence while being co-located for collaborative development purposes. Both theories share interests in recursive structures and emergent phenomena but were developed independently with distinct ontological foundations.

---

## File Count Architecture

File counts in the vault follow **triadic architectural necessity** based on the fundamental Structure-Void-Awareness (SVA) triad that governs Delta Theory:

### **Microkernel (00.0) - Pure SVA Triad**
All categories contain **3 files** reflecting the fundamental triadic structure:
- **Axioms/Theorems:** A0, T1, T2, T3 (foundational axiom + derived triad)
- **Constants:** π, e, φ (mathematical invariants derived from axioms)
- **Boundaries:** ε, c, Cs (operational limits)
- **Modulators:** ∇S, λV, ψA (SVA control parameters)
- **Primitives:** ∆, R(·), ⊚ (core operations)
- **Patterns:** Form, Flow, Field (emergent triadic results)

### **Interface (00.1) - Theorem-Driven Extension**
Interface categories maintain **3 files** based on theorem-derived structural necessities:
- **Theorems:** T4, T5, T6 (interface operational requirements)
- **Constants:** σ, κ, ι (derived from theorems T4, T5, T6 respectively)
- **Primitives:** Gate, Port, Surface (interface boundary operations)
- **Patterns:** Router, Filter, Buffer (primitive enhancement capabilities)

### **Coherence Orchestration (00.2) - Coherence-Specific Extension**
Coherence categories follow **coherence-driven structural necessities**:
- **Theorems:** T7, T8, T9 (coherence mathematical foundations)
- **Constants:** 5 constants (r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability, γ_retention, δ_recovery) derived from coherence theorems
- **Primitives:** Memory, Recovery, Phase (core coherence operations)
- **Patterns:** Persistence, Resilience, Synchronization (modulator-driven primitive enhancement)

**Architectural Principle:** File counts reflect **structural necessity**, not arbitrary mathematical formulas. The consistent triadic pattern emerges from the **fundamental triadic nature of difference-based recursive systems**.

---

## Critical Pattern Distinction

The vault architecture distinguishes between two fundamentally different types of patterns:

### **Foundational Patterns (Microkernel 00.0.5)**
**Nature:** Mathematical results of primitive operations
- **Form, Flow, Field** = Natural emergence from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚
- **Constants:** π, e, φ (universal mathematical invariants)
- **Function:** Provide substrate for further recursive operations
- **No operational rates:** They ARE the results, not processes

### **Operational Patterns (Interface 00.1.3)**
**Nature:** Applied functional tools that enhance interface primitive capabilities
- **Router, Filter, Buffer** = Enhancement patterns extending Gate, Port, Surface operations
- **Timing constraints:** Operate within σ_conservation, κ_discrimination, ι_identity bounds
- **Function:** Provide specialized capabilities while respecting interface constant timing requirements
- **No dedicated rates:** Use interface constants for timing, not separate operational rates

### **Enhanced Patterns (Coherence 00.2.3)**
**Nature:** Advanced functionality patterns that enhance coherence primitive capabilities through modulator effects
- **Persistence, Resilience, Synchronization** = Modulator-driven enhancement patterns extending Memory, Recovery, Phase operations
- **Modulator derivation:** ∇S → Persistence, λV → Resilience, ψA → Synchronization
- **Function:** Provide sophisticated coherence orchestration capabilities through universal modulator effects
- **Timing integration:** Use coherence constants (r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability, γ_retention, δ_recovery) for operational parameters

**Architectural Insight:** This three-tier distinction maintains theoretical purity (microkernel), enables practical application (interface), and provides advanced functionality (coherence) through a clean architectural progression from mathematical emergence to operational enhancement to sophisticated orchestration.

## Symbolic Structure Diagnostic Framework (20.0)

The Symbolic Structure module provides a comprehensive diagnostic classification system for assessing Delta Theory patterns across different scales and contexts:

### **Diagnostic Classification Architecture**
File counts follow **diagnostic necessity** based on comprehensive pattern coverage:

- **Form Classifications (20.0.1):** 4 structure diagnostics derived from ⊚ operation outcomes
  - **Stable Form:** Successful recursive closure with coherent identity
  - **Apparent Form:** Surface coherence masking underlying instability
  - **Collapsed Form:** Failed closure resulting in structural breakdown
  - **Pseudo Form:** False coherence through external constraint rather than internal stability

- **Field Classifications (20.0.2):** 4 void diagnostics grounded in Field pattern and boundary interactions
  - **Transparent Field:** Clear void enabling unimpeded flow and filtering
  - **Masked Field:** Partially obscured void with selective filtering capabilities
  - **Saturated Field:** Overwhelmed void at capacity limits with jamming effects
  - **Sparse Field:** Under-utilized void with minimal filtering and flow

- **Awareness Classifications (20.0.3):** 4 awareness diagnostics derived from ψA modulation and coherence theorems
  - **Coherent Awareness:** Synchronized phase relationships enabling stable identity
  - **Desynchronized Awareness:** Phase conflicts creating identity instability
  - **Intermittent Awareness:** Periodic coherence with temporal gaps
  - **Overbound Awareness:** Excessive phase locking preventing adaptive response

- **Propagation Patterns (20.0.4):** 5 network topology diagnostics grounded in Flow pattern dynamics
  - **Path (chain):** Linear sequential flow connections
  - **Multi-path (redundant):** Parallel flow paths providing resilience
  - **Cycle (feedback loop):** Recursive flow enabling self-reinforcement
  - **Bridge - Articulation:** Critical connection points enabling network coherence
  - **Cascade:** Amplifying flow creating downstream effects

- **Interaction Dynamics (20.0.5):** 4 phase interaction diagnostics derived from phase coherence theory
  - **Resonance:** Constructive phase alignment creating controlled amplification
  - **Interference:** Pattern mixing through signal superposition
  - **Harmony:** Flexible coherence enabling adaptive alignment
  - **Dissonance:** Persistent phase conflict creating productive tension

**Diagnostic Principle:** Each classification provides systematic assessment tools with clear theoretical grounding in Translation Layer foundations (∆, R(·), ⊚, SVA modulators), enabling scale-aware pattern recognition across micro, human, and cosmic boundaries.

## Contribution Guidelines

To keep the vault stable and traceable:

1. Respect triadic recursion (no unanchored folders)

2. If adding a new concept, determine:

    - What layer it belongs to (Structure / Void / Awareness)

    - What role it plays (primitive, function, modulation, interface, etc.)

3. All files should use **Obsidian-compatible Markdown**

4. Use internal links (`[[Like This]]`) to connect notes

5. See [[README.md]], [[PRINCIPLES.md]], and [[CONTRIBUTORS.md]] for more
## Assets

Attachments follow two placement modes:

- Per‑note assets: store next to the note in a subfolder named `_assets/` (Obsidian setting: Default location for new attachments → "In subfolder next to current file").
- Shared assets: use `Delta Theory/90 - Assets/` for logos, canonical diagrams, and widely reused media.

Conventions:
- Prefix filenames with the note slug; keep diagram source with export (e.g., `.drawio` + `.svg`).
- Promote frequently reused assets from local `_assets/` to `90 - Assets/` to reduce duplication.

## Filename Naming Conventions

| Type | Naming Pattern | Example |
|------|----------------|---------|
| **constant** | `symbol — Name (constant).md` | `κ_discrimination — Interface Discrimination Rate (constant).md` |
| **glossary** | `Term (glossary).md` | `Field (glossary).md` |
| **primitive** | `Name (primitive).md` | `Delta (primitive).md` |
| **modulator** | `symbol — Name (modulator).md` | `∇S — Structure Gradient (modulator).md` |
| **pattern** | `Name (pattern).md` | `Form (pattern).md` |
| **boundary** | `symbol — Name (boundary).md` | `ε — Resolution Quantum (boundary).md` |
| **axiom** | `symbol — Name (axiom).md` | `A0 — Existential Difference (axiom).md` |
| **theorem** | `symbol — Name (theorem).md` | `T1 — Irreducibility (theorem).md` |

**Governance Principle:** All files use **type-only naming** with the type indicated in parentheses. Functional distinctions are handled through YAML frontmatter and folder structure rather than filename classes.

## Closing

This vault is both a **repository** and a **recursive machine**. It grows by holding difference — not by accumulation, but by resonance.

To contribute is to **stabilize difference**.

To refactor is to **unfold clarity**.

To read is to **modulate awareness**.
