  "description": "Delta Theory proposes difference (∆) as the fundamental basis of reality, offering a novel approach to understanding complex systems. It demonstrates how differences create structure through recursive cycles of propagation and stabilization, bridging the gap between physical and cognitive domains. The theory uniquely balances technical precision with experiential meaning through a dual-register approach, making it valuable for both scientific modeling and human understanding.\n\nAt its core, difference (∆) represents any detectable variation or contrast that can propagate and influence other differences. This leads to emergent structures governed by five universal constants (ε: quantum of difference, π: closure ratio, e: natural growth rate, φ: golden mean, c: propagation limit) and modulated by three fundamental processes (∇S: structural differentiation, λV: void resonance, ψA: awareness coherence).\n\nThe theory's significance lies in its ability to explain how simple differences evolve into complex, stable structures across scales — from quantum phenomena to cognitive processes, from biological systems to social dynamics. This repository contains the ontological framework, conceptual notes, and documentation (not software) that formalize these principles.",
