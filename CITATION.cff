title: "Delta Theory: Ontological Core and Recursive Stabilization Framework"
abstract: "A universal framework for investigating how systems evolve through recursive difference propagation. Delta Theory explores how differences form, flow, and stabilize across domains from physics to cognition, providing investigative pathways for approaching adaptive systems and understanding structural emergence."
