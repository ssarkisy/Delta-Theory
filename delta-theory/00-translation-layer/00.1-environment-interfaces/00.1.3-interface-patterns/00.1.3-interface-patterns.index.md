# 00.1.3 - Interface Patterns (index)

> Applied functional tools that provide specialized operational capabilities for field interaction: intelligent routing, quality discrimination, and temporal coherence management.

---

## Module Overview

Operational Patterns are applied functional tools that emerge from modulator effects and provide specialized capabilities that enhance the core interface primitives:

- **Router:** Structural flow organization and path determination (derived from ∇S - Structure)
- **Filter:** Threshold discrimination and quality assessment (derived from λV - Void)
- **Buffer:** Temporal coherence and state retention (derived from ψA - Awareness)

**Key Distinction:** These are **operational patterns** (applied functional tools) as opposed to **foundational patterns** (mathematical emergence results found in microkernel layer).

Unlike Interface Primitives (Port, Gate, Surface) which derive directly from core structural primitives (∆, R(·), ⊚), Operational Patterns emerge from modulator effects and provide supporting functionality that enables more sophisticated interface behaviors.

## Content Structure

| Pattern | Class | Polarity | Function | Modulator Source |
|---------|-------|----------|----------|------------------|
| [[router.pattern\|Router (pattern)]] | operational | P+ | Structural flow organization | ∇S (Structure) |
| [[filter.pattern\|Filter (pattern)]] | operational | P- | Quality discrimination | λV (Void) |
| [[buffer.pattern\|Buffer (pattern)]] | operational | P0 | Temporal coherence | ψA (Awareness) |

**Metadata Standard:**
- **Type:** `pattern` (consistent with foundational patterns)
- **Class:** `operational` (distinguishes from foundational patterns)
- **Template:** `pattern` (shared template with class-specific sections)

Each operational pattern provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Modulator derivation and operational rates
- Applied functional semantics
- Integration with core primitives

## Pattern Derivation Diagram

**Interface Theorem + Modulator → Enhanced Pattern**

```
Interface Theorems (T4, T5, T6)    +    Modulators (∇S, λV, ψA)    →    Enhanced Patterns
        ↓                                        ↓                            ↓
T4 (Conservation, P+)           +    ∇S (Structure)           →    Router (Enhanced Conservation)
T5 (Discrimination, P-)         +    λV (Void Resonance)      →    Filter (Enhanced Discrimination)
T6 (Identity, P0)               +    ψA (Awareness Phase)     →    Buffer (Enhanced Identity)
```

**Derivation Logic:**
- **Router**: T4 provides flow conservation requirement + ∇S provides structural analysis → intelligent routing with conservation
- **Filter**: T5 provides discrimination requirement + λV provides threshold sensitivity → quality filtering with discrimination
- **Buffer**: T6 provides identity persistence requirement + ψA provides temporal coherence → state management with identity

**SVA Progression**: Router (P+) → Filter (P-) → Buffer (P0) maintains canonical polarity flow

## Emergent Coordination

**Coordination through Core Principles** (not external protocols):

**Field-Based Coordination:**
- All patterns operate within shared **Field (P0)** context from foundational layer
- Field provides **"temporal synchronization and phase coherence"** naturally
- **"Coordination Orchestration"** emerges from Field pattern properties

**Modulator-Based Synchronization:**
- All patterns share same modulators (∇S, λV, ψA) creating natural alignment
- **ψA** specifically manages **"field coherence and temporal coordination"**
- Modulator effects create **intrinsic synchronization** without external protocols

**SVA Flow Coordination:**
- **Router (P+) → Filter (P-) → Buffer (P0)** follows canonical polarity progression
- Natural **P+ → P- → P0** flow creates **self-organizing coordination**
- Each pattern **enhances** others through recursive interdependence

**Recursive Interdependence:**
- Patterns coordinate through **Form-Flow-Field relationships** from foundational layer
- **"Fields enable form emergence"** and **"Forms structure fields"**
- **Self-stabilizing coordination** through recursive feedback loops

## Key Principles

1. **Theorem + Modulator Derivation**
   - Router emerges from T4 (Conservation) + ∇S (Structure) - enhanced flow conservation with structural intelligence
   - Filter emerges from T5 (Discrimination) + λV (Void) - enhanced discrimination with threshold sensitivity
   - Buffer emerges from T6 (Identity) + ψA (Awareness) - enhanced identity persistence with temporal coherence

2. **Supporting Function Role**
   - Patterns are supporting services that enhance primitive operations
   - Support core primitives (Port, Gate, Surface) without replacing them
   - Provide "memory" and "continuity" layers for sophisticated interface behaviors

3. **Operational vs Foundational**
   - These are operational patterns (applied functional tools)
   - Distinguished from foundational patterns (mathematical emergence results)
   - Complete triadic coverage corresponding to three core modulators
