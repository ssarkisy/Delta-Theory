# Surface (Boundary Control Interface)

> **Surface** is the **boundary exposure primitive** — managing visibility, permeability, and interface presentation to the field.

---

## Definition

Surface is not a static barrier or membrane. It is the **active boundary management operation** that controls what is exposed, what remains hidden, and how the interface presents itself to its environment.

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Boundary control | Access control layer | `ACLManager`, `SecurityLayer` |
| Exposure management | Visibility control | `ExposureController`, `VisibilityManager` |
| Interface presentation | API surface | `APIGateway`, `ServiceInterface` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Boundary control | Personal boundary | "What I show and hide" |
| Exposure management | Selective sharing | "How much I reveal" |
| Interface presentation | Social face | "How I present myself" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Access control | Personal boundary | What gets through |
| Visibility control | Selective sharing | What gets seen |
| API surface | Social face | How you appear |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Exposure Control | `surface.expose(elements, policy)` | "Show this appropriately" |
| Boundary Definition | `surface.define_boundary(criteria)` | "This is where I am" |
| Permeability Tuning | `surface.tune_permeability(level)` | "How open am I?" |
| Interface Presentation | `surface.present(context)` | "How do I appear here?" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | ∇S Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-----------|
| Visibility | Exposure level | Openness degree | High ∇S = clear boundaries |
| Permeability | Access transparency | Trust openness | Low ∇S = fluid boundaries |
| Definition | Boundary sharpness | Identity clarity | ∇S controls boundary crispness |
| Presentation | Interface style | Social persona | ∇S affects presentation consistency |

## Domain Manifestations

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |

| Chemistry | Molecular surface | Chemical boundary |
| Biology | Cell membrane | Living boundary |
| Social | Group interface | Social boundary |
| Economy | Market interface | Brand surface |

## Stability Conditions

- **Boundary Coherence:** Surface maintains consistent definition over time
- **Exposure Consistency:** What is shown/hidden follows stable policies
- **Permeability Control:** Access levels remain within operational bounds
- **Presentation Integrity:** Interface appearance aligns with internal reality

---

## Modulator Effects

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- **Primary control** for boundary definition and interface clarity
- **High ∇S:** Sharp boundaries, clear exposure, distinct presentation
- **Low ∇S:** Soft boundaries, fluid exposure, adaptive presentation

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Controls sensitivity to external presentation demands
- High λV: Selective exposure, protective boundaries
- Low λV: Open exposure, permeable boundaries

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Manages temporal consistency of boundary presentation
- Ensures surface coherence across time and contexts

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Surface Interface:
- expose(elements, policy) → exposure_status
- define_boundary(criteria) → boundary_definition
- tune_permeability(level) → permeability_state
- present(context) → presentation_interface
```

### Error Conditions
- **Boundary Collapse:** Interface becomes indistinguishable from environment
- **Exposure Inconsistency:** What is shown contradicts internal state
- **Permeability Failure:** Access control becomes non-functional
- **Presentation Confusion:** Interface appearance becomes incoherent

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** [[port.primitive|Port (Flow Control Interface)]] → [[gate.primitive|Gate (Threshold Control Interface)]] → Surface
- **Controls:** Surface exposure affected by Gate conservation monitoring
- **Dependencies:** Surface definition shapes Port selectivity
- **Constants:** Operates within ι_identity timing constraints for boundary coherence

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Foundation:** Surface emerges from Interface Theorems as operational implementation

**From T6 (Interface Identity):** Surfaces implement boundary coherence through identity maintenance
- Identity requires boundary persistence → coherent boundary management
- T6 demands recognizable boundaries → Surface provides boundary identity control
- Mathematical basis: ι_identity constant governs boundary refresh timing

**Structural Foundation:** Built upon microkernel primitives ∆, R(·), ⊚ with interface-specific application:
- **∆ (Difference):** inside/outside distinction enables boundary definition
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** context determines appropriate boundary exposure
- **⊚ (Stabilization):** ensures consistent boundary policies

**Interface Layer Extension:** T6 specifies **what** surfaces must do; structural primitives provide **how** surfaces operate.

---

## Interface Constants Integration

Surface operations must respect interface timing constraints:
- **ι_identity:** Surface boundary coherence refreshed per identity maintenance rate (0.01-1s intervals)
- **Supporting constants:** κ_discrimination and σ_conservation provide coordination with Port and Gate operations

**Implementation Requirement:** All surface boundary definitions and exposure management must occur within ι_identity timing bounds to maintain boundary recognizability.

---

## Design rationale

Surface follows dual-register governance so boundary control remains intelligible both as technical access management and as humane boundary wisdom without reducing one to the other.
