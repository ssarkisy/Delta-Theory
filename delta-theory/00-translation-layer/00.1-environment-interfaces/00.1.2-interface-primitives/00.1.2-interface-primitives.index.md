# 00.1.2 - Interface Primitives (index)

> Core interface operations derived from structural primitives: Port (flow control), Gate (threshold control), Surface (boundary control).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental interface primitives that enable controlled field interaction, derived from the full structural primitive sequence (∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F):

- **Gate:** Threshold activation and condition monitoring (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to threshold contexts)
- **Port:** Flow control and directional management (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to flow contexts)
- **Surface:** Boundary exposure and permeability control (from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to boundary contexts)

These primitives work together as the **core interface operations** that implement structure-field interaction. They are supported by Operational Patterns (such as Buffer) which provide additional capabilities derived from modulator effects.

|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Interface Primitives | Core operations | [[port.primitive\|Port (Flow Control Interface)]], [[gate.primitive\|Gate (Threshold Control Interface)]], [[surface.primitive\|Surface (Boundary Control Interface)]] | P-/P+/P0 |
| Primitive Derivation | Structural grounding | ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to flow/threshold/boundary contexts | SVA triad |
| Theorem Mapping | Grounding principles | T4 → Gate (P+), T5 → Port (P-), T6 → Surface (P0) | P+ → P- → P0 |
| Operational Flow | Interface sequence | Port (receive) → Gate (evaluate) → Surface (expose) | Canonical |
| Support Patterns | Enhancement functions | Extended patterns (when implemented) | Modulated |

Each primitive provides:
- Technical and humane mappings
- Operational semantics
- Control interfaces
- Domain manifestations

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Derivation**
   - All interface primitives derive from ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F applied to specific contexts
   - Port: flow context, Gate: threshold context, Surface: boundary context
   - Each primitive implements the full structural sequence in its domain

2. **Theorem Grounding**
   - Gate operations implement T4 (Interface Conservation) principles
   - Port operations implement T5 (Interface Discrimination) principles
   - Surface operations implement T6 (Interface Identity) principles

3. **Interface Coordination**
   - Primitives work together as coordinated interface operations
   - Canonical sequence: Port (receive) → Gate (evaluate) → Surface (expose)
   - Each primitive respects interface constants (σ_conservation, κ_discrimination, ι_identity)
