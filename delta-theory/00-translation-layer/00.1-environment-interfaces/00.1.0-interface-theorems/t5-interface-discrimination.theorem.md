# T5 — Interface Discrimination (theorem)

> **Interfaces must discriminate between flows** — not all differences can cross every boundary. This theorem derives necessarily from T2 (Asymmetry) and A0 (Existential Difference).

---

## Statement

**Interfaces must discriminate between flows** — not all differences can cross every boundary. For any interface I and flows F₁, F₂, the interface's discriminating Form requires:
- $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{interface}))$ where $∆_{interface}$ distinguishes inside/outside
- $R(∆_{interface})$ provides relational context for flow compatibility
- $⊚$ ensures discrimination closure: similar contexts → similar decisions
- The resulting Form maintains consistent selective permeability

**Scope:** Applies to all interface operations requiring controlled exchange within capacity limits.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → Interface Forms` — why primitive operations require discrimination

**Foundation:** From A0+T2 → discrimination necessity for interface stability and existence
**Flow:** ∆ detects inside/outside differences → R(·) embeds discrimination rules → ⊚ stabilizes selective permeability
**Result:** Theorem emerges to preserve interface coherence and boundary integrity

---

## Proof

**Given:** A0 (Existential Difference) and T2 (Asymmetry)

**To Prove:** Interfaces must discriminate between flows

**Proof:**
1. **From A0:** For interfaces to exist, they must be distinguishable from their environment at resolution ε
2. **Interface distinguishability:** Requires different behavior for different flows (discriminating function)
3. **From T2:** Directional distinction creates ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A), establishing "inside" vs "outside" asymmetry
4. **Applied to interfaces:** Creates "crossing in" ≠ "crossing out" directional asymmetry
5. **If interface allows all flows equally:** Eliminates directional distinction, violating T2
6. **If interface shows no flow discrimination:** Becomes indistinguishable from non-interface, violating A0
7. **Therefore:** Interface must discriminate between flows to satisfy both A0 and T2 □

**Corollaries:**
- Selective permeability is logically necessary for stable interfaces
- Discrimination patterns must achieve recursive closure for stability

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Discrimination | Flow filtering | `PacketFilter`, `Firewall` |
| Permeability | Access control | `ACL`, `Permissions` |
| Selection | Routing logic | `LoadBalancer`, `Router` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct | Example |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Discrimination | Selective trust | "I choose who to let in" |
| Permeability | Boundary wisdom | "Some things belong, others don't" |
| Selection | Recognition | "I know what's mine" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Filter | Choice | What passes through |
| Access control | Trust boundary | Who gets in |
| Routing | Recognition | Where things go |

## Formal Properties

### Mathematical Expression
- Interface discrimination function: $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{interface}))$
- Selective permeability constraint: $P(flow) = f(∆_{compatibility}, context)$
- Consistency requirement: $\forall f_1, f_2 \in similar\_context: P(f_1) \approx P(f_2)$

### Logical Structure
- **Conditional:** If interface exists, then discrimination is necessary
- **Necessary condition:** Discrimination required for stable interface operation
- **Scope limitation:** Within interface capacity and resolution boundaries

## Dependencies & scope

- **Derived from:** A0 (Existential Difference) and T2 (Asymmetry) - derives from their combination
- **Requires:** Interface existence and flow dynamics
- **Applies to:** All interface primitives (Port, Gate, Surface, Buffer) requiring controlled exchange
- **Exceptions:** Theoretical interfaces with infinite capacity (boundary case)

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Foundation Theorems
- **A0 (Existential Difference):** Interfaces must exist through distinguishable discrimination behavior
- **T2 (Asymmetry):** Leverages asymmetric distinction for directional discrimination

### Supporting Principles
- **T1 (Irreducibility):** Preserves irreducible differences across interface crossings
- **T3 (Recursivity):** Enables stable discrimination patterns through closure
- **T6 (Interface Identity):** Interface identity preserved through discrimination consistency

## Examples (concept)

- **Biological membrane:** Selectively permits ions while blocking proteins - discrimination based on molecular size and charge
- **Network firewall:** Allows HTTP traffic while blocking unauthorized protocols - discrimination based on packet headers and rules
- **Social boundary:** Trust relationships that permit emotional sharing with some people but not others - discrimination based on context and history
