# T6 — Interface Identity (theorem)

> **Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity** — the interface itself must persist as a recognizable entity through all interactions. This theorem derives necessarily from A0 (Existential Difference) and T1 (Irreducibility).

---

## Statement

**Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity** — the interface itself must persist as a recognizable entity through all interactions. For any interface I operating over time t, boundary integrity requires:
- $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{identity}))$ where $∆_{identity}$ makes the interface recognizable
- $R(∆_{identity})$ embeds distinguishing features in stable relational context
- $⊚$ ensures recursive identity reinforcement across time
- The resulting Form maintains recognizable boundary coherence

**Scope:** Applies to all interfaces requiring persistent identity across time and interactions.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → Persistent Interface Forms` — why primitive operations require identity maintenance

**Foundation:** From A0+T1 → identity coherence necessity for interface existence and stability
**Flow:** ∆ detects identity-defining differences → R(·) embeds identity features in stable relations → ⊚ achieves recursive identity reinforcement
**Result:** Theorem emerges to preserve interface coherence and recognizable boundary integrity over time

---

## Proof

**Given:** A0 (Existential Difference) and T1 (Irreducibility)

**To Prove:** Interface boundaries must maintain coherent identity

**Proof:**
1. **From A0:** For interfaces to exist, they must be distinguishable from their environment at resolution ε
2. **Interface distinguishability:** Requires persistent identity features that remain recognizable over time
3. **From T1:** Identity-defining differences must be irreducible to preserve interface existence
4. **Identity requirement:** Interface-environment distinction must be maintained without decomposition
5. **If interface lacks persistent identity:** Becomes indistinguishable from environment, violating A0
6. **If interface identity decomposes:** Violates T1 (loses irreducible distinction)
7. **Therefore:** Interface must maintain coherent identity to satisfy both A0 and T1 □

**Corollaries:**
- Identity persistence is logically necessary for stable interfaces
- Boundary coherence requires recursive self-reinforcement mechanisms

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|---------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Identity maintenance | State consistency | `StateManager`, `IdentityStore` |
| Boundary coherence | Interface definition | `APIContract`, `ServiceInterface` |
| Persistent character | Configuration stability | `ConfigManager`, `ProfileStore` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct | Example |
|---------------|------------------|---------|
| Identity maintenance | Self-recognition | "I know who I am" |
| Boundary coherence | Personal boundaries | "This is where I begin and end" |
| Persistent character | Core identity | "I remain myself through change" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| State consistency | Self-recognition | What stays the same |
| Interface definition | Personal boundary | Where self meets other |
| Configuration stability | Core identity | What makes you you |

## Formal Properties

### Mathematical Expression
- Identity preservation function: $F_I = ⊚(R(∆_{identity}))$
- Continuity constraint: $Identity(t) \approx Identity(t+\delta t)$ for small $\delta t$
- Coherence requirement: $\forall \text{ interaction } i: F_I(i) = F_I$ (identity preserved)

### Logical Structure
- **Conditional:** If interface exists, then identity coherence is necessary
- **Necessary condition:** Identity maintenance required for interface persistence
- **Scope limitation:** Within interface capacity and temporal coherence boundaries

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Foundation Theorems
- **A0 (Existential Difference):** Interfaces must exist through distinguishable identity features
- **T1 (Irreducibility):** Preserves irreducible interface-environment distinction

### Supporting Principles
- **T4 (Interface Conservation):** Identity conservation enables resource preservation
- **T5 (Interface Discrimination):** Identity enables consistent discrimination patterns

## Examples (concept)

- **API versioning:** Software interface maintains backward compatibility while evolving - identity preserved through semantic versioning
