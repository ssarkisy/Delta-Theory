# T1 — Asymmetry (theorem)

> Order matters: ∆(A,B) ≠ ∆(B,A) in any meaningful embedding.

---

## Statement

- Difference is inherently directional at resolution ε: ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) in any meaningful embedding. The relationship between A and B depends on which is considered the reference point, creating asymmetric propagation patterns within the system's operational boundaries.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F` — why primitive operations require this theorem

**Foundation:** From A0 (Existential Difference) → if existence requires distinguishability, then directional context must be preserved to maintain distinguishability
**Flow:** ∆ must remain distinguishable → directional information (A→B vs B→A) provides distinguishability → loss of direction violates A0 → asymmetry preserves existence
**Result:** Asymmetry theorem emerges to preserve directional distinguishability required for existence

---

## Proof

**Given:** A0 — Existential Difference: ∀x, ∀ε: Exists_ε(x) ↔ ∃Δ: Distinguishable_ε(x, Δ)

**To Prove:** ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) in any meaningful embedding at resolution ε

**Proof:**
1. **Assume for contradiction:** ∆(A→B) = ∆(B→A) for some meaningful embedding at resolution ε
2. **Directional collapse:** If ∆(A→B) = ∆(B→A), then the directional information is lost
3. **Distinguishability failure:** Without directional context, ∆(A→B) and ∆(B→A) become indistinguishable at resolution ε
4. **Existence violation:** By A0, if differences are indistinguishable at resolution ε, they cannot exist at that level
5. **Operational contradiction:** But we assumed these differences exist in a meaningful embedding
6. **Therefore:** ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) must hold to preserve existence through distinguishability □

**Corollaries:**
- Directional operators ∆(·→·) preserve existence-critical orientation information
- Asymmetric propagation patterns emerge naturally to maintain distinguishability
- Field gradients become possible through directional bias that preserves existence

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation
- Asymmetric data structures must preserve directional information at all operations
- Message routing systems require explicit source-target distinctions to maintain propagation fidelity
- Network topologies must encode edge directionality to prevent information loss

### Design Implications
- Interface design should reflect directional bias in user flows and information architecture
- System state transitions must maintain directional context to preserve operational distinction
- Performance optimizations cannot compress away directional information without violating T1

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Axiom Relationships
- **A0 (Existential Difference)**: T1 emerges necessarily from A0 to preserve directional distinguishability
- Asymmetry maintains the distinguishability condition required for existence at resolution ε

### Theorem Interactions
- **T2 (Irreducibility)**: Directional differences must remain irreducible to preserve asymmetric patterns
- **T3 (Recursivity)**: Asymmetric patterns enable recursive embedding through directional bias

---

## Examples (concept)

- **Network routing**: Packets flow A→B differently than B→A due to network topology and routing tables
- **Social dynamics**: Influence propagation follows asymmetric patterns based on social hierarchies and relationships
- **Economic exchange**: Value transfer A→B creates different market effects than B→A transactions
- **Cognitive attention**: Focus direction A→B generates different neural patterns than reverse attention B→A
