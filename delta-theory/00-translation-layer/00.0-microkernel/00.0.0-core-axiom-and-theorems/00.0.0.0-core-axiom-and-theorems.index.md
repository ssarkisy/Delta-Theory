# 00.0.0.0 - Core Axiom & Theorems (index)

> Foundational axiom and derived theorems that ground the kernel primitives and enable difference-based recursion.

---

## Module Overview

The Core Axiom & Theorems module provides the foundational basis of Delta Theory. It defines:
- **One foundational axiom (A0)** that establishes existence through distinguishability
- **Three derived theorems (T1, T2, T3)** that follow necessarily from A0
- Their mapping to the VSA triad (Void, Structure, Awareness)
- The emergence of core constants and boundaries
- Guidelines for domain-specific implementations

This elegant foundation demonstrates remarkable theoretical unity: all of ∆-Theory emerges from the single principle of existential difference.

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements |
|----------|-------------|--------------|
| Foundational Axiom | Existence-distinguishability principle | [[a0-existential-difference.axiom\|A0 — Existential Difference (axiom)]] |
| Derived Theorems | Necessary consequences of A0 | [[t1-asymmetry.theorem\|T1 — Asymmetry (theorem)]], [[t2-irreducibility.theorem\|T2 — Irreducibility (theorem)]], [[t3-recursivity.theorem\|T3 — Recursivity (theorem)]] |
| VSA Mapping | Polarity and domain alignment | A0 → P+/P-/P0 (All), T1 → P- (Void), T2 → P+ (Structure), T3 → P0 (Awareness) |
| Boundaries | Direct operational limits | ε (resolution), c (propagation), Cs (stability) |
| Constants | Derived mathematical relationships | e (growth), φ (asymmetric ratio), π (closure ratio) |

The axiom and theorems provide:
- **A0 (Axiom):** Foundational existence-distinguishability principle enabling all polarities
- **T1 (Theorem):** Directional flow through asymmetry (derived from A0)
- **T2 (Theorem):** Structure preservation through irreducibility (derived from A0)
- **T3 (Theorem):** Pattern recognition through recursivity (derived from A0)
- Technical and humane mappings for all
- Clear derivation chains showing logical necessity

## Key Principles

1. **Single-Axiom Foundation**
   - A0 is the foundational axiom establishing existence through distinguishability
   - T1, T2, T3 are derived consequences, not independent principles
   - Clear derivation chains: A0 → T1, A0 → T2, A0 → T3

2. **VSA Triad Alignment**
   - A0 (Existential Difference) → P+/P-/P0 (All): Enables all polarities
   - T1 (Asymmetry) → P- (Void): Field directionality
   - T2 (Irreducibility) → P+ (Structure): Form preservation
   - T3 (Recursivity) → P0 (Awareness): Pattern recognition

3. **Derivation Patterns**
   - φ, c emerge from A0 → T1 (existence and asymmetry)
   - e, ε emerge from A0 → T2 (existence and irreducibility)
   - π, Cs emerge from A0 → T3 (existence and recursivity)
