# T2 — Irreducibility (theorem)

> At resolution ε, primitive differences cannot be decomposed without loss of existence.

---

## Statement

- At resolution ε, primitive differences cannot be decomposed without loss of existence at that level. Any attempt to decompose a primitive difference into sub-ε components eliminates the distinguishability condition required for existence, violating A0.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F` — why primitive operations require this theorem

**Foundation:** From A0 (Existential Difference) → if existence requires distinguishability, then decomposing distinguishable differences destroys existence
**Flow:** ∆ must remain distinguishable → decomposition below ε threshold → loss of distinguishability → violation of A0 → loss of existence
**Result:** Irreducibility theorem emerges to preserve existence condition for primitive differences

---

## Proof

**Given:** A0 — Existential Difference: ∀x, ∀ε: Exists_ε(x) ↔ ∃Δ: Distinguishable_ε(x, Δ)

**To Prove:** At resolution ε, primitive differences cannot be decomposed without loss of existence

**Proof:**
1. **Assume for contradiction:** A primitive difference ∆ at resolution ε can be decomposed into components {∆₁, ∆₂, ...} while maintaining existence
2. **By A0:** For ∆ to exist at resolution ε, it must satisfy the distinguishability condition: |∆| ≥ ε
3. **Decomposition requirement:** If ∆ = f(∆₁, ∆₂, ...), then each component must contribute to the total distinguishability
4. **Sub-threshold components:** For true decomposition, components must be smaller: |∆ᵢ| < ε for all i
5. **Distinguishability failure:** Components with |∆ᵢ| < ε cannot satisfy A0's existence condition at resolution ε
6. **Existence contradiction:** If components don't exist at resolution ε, their composition cannot exist at resolution ε
7. **Therefore:** Primitive differences at resolution ε cannot be decomposed without loss of existence □
