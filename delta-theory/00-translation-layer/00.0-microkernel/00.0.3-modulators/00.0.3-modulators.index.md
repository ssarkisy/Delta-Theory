# 00.0.3 - Modulators (index)

> Control parameters that tune recursive system behavior: the SVA triad (∇S, λV, ψA) that modulates Structure, Void, and Awareness dynamics.

**Derivation Trace:** ∆ → A0/T1/T2/T3 → Constants & Boundaries → Modulators (∇S, λV, ψA)

**Note:** The **[[polarity.glossary|Polarity (glossary)]]** conceptual framework (P+/P-/P0) is defined in the [[20.0.0-glossary.index|20.0.0 - Glossary (index)]] as it provides the organizational principle that the modulators implement, rather than being a modulator itself.

---

## Module Overview

Modulators are the primary control parameters that tune how the microkernel operates in specific contexts. Unlike constants (which are invariant) or boundaries (which are hard limits), modulators are **adjustable parameters** that customize system behavior while respecting fundamental constraints.

The SVA (Structure-Void-Awareness) triad provides:
- **∇S (Structure):** Controls depth and granularity of structural differentiation
- **λV (Void):** Sets thresholds for field resonance and transition states
- **ψA (Awareness):** Manages phase coherence and temporal coordination

Together, these modulators enable the microkernel to adapt to different domains while maintaining theoretical consistency.

## Key Principles

1. **SVA Triad Control**
   - ∇S (P+): Controls structural depth and boundary clarity
   - λV (P-): Sets field thresholds and transition sensitivity
   - ψA (P0): Manages temporal coordination and phase coherence

2. **Adjustable Parameters**
   - Unlike constants (invariant) or boundaries (hard limits)
   - Modulators are tunable for domain-specific optimization
   - Enable microkernel adaptation while maintaining theoretical consistency

3. **Pattern Modulation**
   - Control how Form, Flow, and Field patterns emerge and interact
   - ∇S tunes structural differentiation in patterns
   - λV sets thresholds for pattern transitions
   - ψA manages pattern coherence and coordination

4. **Triadic Balance**
   - Modulators work together through recursive feedback
   - Each affects the others: ∇S → λV → ψA → ∇S
   - Balanced settings maintain stable recursive operation
