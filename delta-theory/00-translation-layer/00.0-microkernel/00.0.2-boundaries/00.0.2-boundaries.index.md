# 00.0.2 - Boundaries (index)

> Operational limits that define the feasible envelope for stable recursive forms: resolution thresholds, propagation speeds, and capacity constraints.

**Derivation Trace:** ∆ → A0 (Existential Difference) → T1/T2/T3 (Asymmetry/Irreducibility/Recursivity) → Boundaries (c, ε, Cs)

## Module Overview

Boundaries represent the operational constraints that recursive difference-based systems must respect to maintain stability and coherence. They define the limits within which the microkernel can operate effectively.

Each boundary:
- **Derives from axioms/theorems** as necessary operational constraints
- **Sets hard limits** that cannot be exceeded without system breakdown
- **Enables stable operation** by preventing overflow, underflow, and instability
- **Manifests domain-specifically** while maintaining conceptual consistency

## Content Structure

| Boundary | Derivation | Role | Constraint Type |
|----------|------------|------|-----------------|
| [[c-difference-propagation-limit.boundary\|c — Difference Propagation Limit (boundary)]] | A0+T1 (Existence+Asymmetry) | Maximum propagation speed | Rate limit |
| [[epsilon-difference-resolution-quantum.boundary\|ε — Difference Resolution Quantum (boundary)]] | A0+T2 (Existence+Irreducibility) | Minimal meaningful difference | Lower bound |
| [[cs-stability-capacity.boundary\|Cs — Stability Capacity (boundary)]] | A0+T3 (Existence+Recursivity) | Maximum difference load | Upper bound |

Each boundary provides operational constraint definition, dual-register mapping, domain manifestations, and formal mathematical relationships.

## Key Principles

1. **Operational Constraint Foundation**
   - Boundaries derive from foundational axiom A0 + microkernel theorems (T1, T2, T3)
   - Define hard operational limits that cannot be exceeded without system breakdown
   - Each boundary addresses a different type of constraint (resolution, speed, capacity)

2. **Complete Operational Envelope**
   - Three boundaries define complete operational envelope: `ε ≤ differences ≤ Cs` with `propagation ≤ c`
   - c from A0+T1 (Existence+Asymmetry), ε from A0+T2 (Existence+Irreducibility), Cs from A0+T3 (Existence+Recursivity)
   - All microkernel operations must respect boundary constraints
   - Boundaries are hard constraints - violation causes system failure

3. **Domain Implementation Requirements**
   - Domain implementations must map conceptual boundaries to specific values
   - Domain-specific boundary values must maintain conceptual consistency
   - Boundary violations indicate architectural or implementation problems
