# 00.0 - Microkernel (index)

> The minimal kernel of Delta Theory: foundational axioms, derived theorems, core primitives, and control parameters that enable difference-based recursion.

---

## Module Overview

The Microkernel contains the irreducible foundation of Delta Theory - everything needed for the basic recursive operations that transform difference into stable forms:

- **Core Axiom & Theorems:** Foundational axiom (A0) and derived theorems (T1, T2, T3) that ground all operations
- **Mathematical Constants:** Derived relationships (φ, e, π) that emerge from the axioms
- **Operational Boundaries:** System limits (c, ε, Cs) that constrain operations
- **Control Modulators:** Tuning parameters (λV, ∇S, ψA) that modulate system behavior
- **Structural Primitives:** Core operations (R(·), ∆, ⊚) that implement the transformations
- **Foundational Patterns:** Mathematical results (Flow, Form, Field) that emerge from successful primitive operations

This microkernel provides the minimal foundation that could exist standalone, from which all other Delta Theory structures emerge.

## Key Principles

1. **Single-Axiom Foundation**
   - Everything derives from A0 (Existential Difference) and primitive difference (∆)
   - T1 (Asymmetry), T2 (Irreducibility), and T3 (Recursivity) are proven necessary consequences
   - Clear derivation chains ensure ontological grounding

2. **Minimal Completeness**
   - Self-contained with all dependencies satisfied within microkernel
   - Nothing can be removed without breaking functionality
   - Non-circular derivation chains maintain theoretical consistency

3. **Dual-Register Design**
   - Technical precision for computational implementation
   - Humane accessibility for biological and social contexts
   - Clear crosswalks bridge understanding between registers

4. **Recursive Scalability**
   - Same patterns work at different scales and domains
   - Operations can be applied to their own outputs
   - Self-stabilizing through built-in feedback mechanisms
