## Conceptual Mapping Architecture

### **What Are Conceptual Mappings?**

Conceptual Mappings are **systematic translations** between Delta Theory's ontological concepts and domain-specific manifestations. They preserve theoretical grounding while enabling practical domain applications.

#### **Mapping Structure Pattern**:
```
OntologicalConcept → DomainConcept (concept-mapping):
- ontological_definition() → theoretical foundation from Delta Theory
- domain_manifestation() → how concept appears in specific domain
- bridge_semantics() → dual-register preservation across mapping
- implementation_guidance() → practical usage in domain applications
- validation_criteria() → how to verify mapping correctness
```

#### **Example: OntologicalMass → Mass (Physics)**:
```
OntologicalMass → Mass (concept-mapping):
- ontological_definition(): Stable difference accumulation creating persistent identity
- domain_manifestation(): Inertial and gravitational mass in spacetime
- bridge_semantics():
  - Technical: m = E/c² (mass-energy equivalence)
  - Humane: "How much stuff is there" → "How heavy it feels"
- implementation_guidance(): Use in E=mc², F=ma, gravitational calculations
- validation_criteria(): Conservation laws, equivalence principle, experimental verification
```

#### **Cross-Domain Consistency**:
The same ontological concept maps consistently across domains while respecting domain-specific manifestations:

```
OntologicalEnergy:
├── Physics: E = mc², kinetic/potential energy, thermodynamic energy
├── Networks: Information content, processing energy, transmission energy
└── Biology: Metabolic energy, ATP, cellular energy, ecosystem energy flows
```

### **Why Conceptual Mappings Are Essential**:

1. **Theoretical Grounding**: Maintain connection between universal principles and domain applications
2. **Cross-Domain Consistency**: Ensure same concepts map coherently across different domains
3. **Implementation Guidance**: Provide clear pathways from theory to practical code
4. **Validation Framework**: Enable verification that domain implementations preserve theoretical integrity

## Domain Bridge Architecture Patterns

### Standard Bridge Structure
```
[API]-[Domain] (domain-bridge):
- extend_universal_api(domain_parameters) → domain_specific_interface
- map_domain_constants(universal_params, domain_constants) → specialized_params
- optimize_for_domain(universal_algorithm, domain_constraints) → optimized_algorithm
- validate_domain_consistency(domain_operation) → consistency_status
```

### Physics Bridge Example
```
phaselockloop-physics (domain-bridge):
- synchronize_quantum_oscillators(oscillators, ħ_coupling, frequency) → quantum_sync_status
  └── Extends: PhaseLockLoop.synchronize(components, reference_phase)
- maintain_phase_coherence(quantum_state, decoherence_time, ψA_anchor) → coherence_status
  └── Extends: PhaseLockLoop.maintain_coherence(identity, refresh_interval)
- coordinate_laser_timing(laser_array, c_propagation, phase_constraints) → optical_coordination
  └── Extends: PhaseLockLoop.coordinate_timing(operations, constraints)
```

### Cross-Domain Consistency Protocol
```
Domain Bridge Validation:
- universal_api_compliance(bridge_operation) → compliance_status
- cross_domain_consistency(bridge_set) → consistency_report
- theoretical_grounding(domain_extension) → theoretical_validation
- dual_register_preservation(domain_mapping) → register_integrity
```
