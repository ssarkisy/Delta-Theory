# 01.0 - Functional Interfaces (index)

> Operational API layer that bridges theoretical foundations with concrete domain implementations through minimal, stable functional interfaces with clear operational semantics.

---

## Module Overview

The Functional Interfaces layer provides **operational APIs** that transform theoretical primitives, patterns, and modulators into concrete, implementable function signatures and protocols. This layer serves as the critical bridge between abstract Delta Theory and practical implementation.

The functional interface layer includes:
- **Core Interface APIs:** Direct operational interfaces for modulators (λV, ∇S, ψA)
- **Composite Interface APIs:** Higher-level APIs combining primitives and patterns
- **Interface Protocols:** Cross-cutting protocols for dual-register and stability maintenance

This layer is **essential before mathematical formalization** as it provides operational semantics and implementation pathways needed to validate theoretical predictions through working systems.

## Key Principles

1. **Operational API Design**
   - Transform theoretical constructs into implementable function signatures
   - Provide clear behavioral contracts and operational semantics
   - Enable direct translation to executable code in multiple languages
   - Maintain performance adequate for real-time domain applications

2. **Dual-Register Preservation**
   - Every technical API maintains corresponding humane understanding
   - Semantic consistency protocols prevent register divergence
   - Bridge maintenance ensures both registers remain accessible
   - Implementation preserves theoretical meaning and human comprehension

3. **Modular Composition**
   - Core interfaces provide fundamental modulator control (λV, ∇S, ψA)
   - Composite interfaces combine primitives for sophisticated operations
   - Interface protocols ensure system-wide consistency and coordination
   - Layered design enables both simple and complex use cases

4. **Domain Agnostic Foundation**
   - APIs work consistently across Physics, Networks, Biology, and other domains
   - Standardized interfaces prevent domain-specific fragmentation
   - Common protocols enable cross-domain interoperability
   - Theoretical grounding ensures universal applicability

## Development Status

**Current Phase:** Planning and Architecture Design
**Priority:** Critical (required before mathematical formalization)
**Dependencies:** Microkernel (00.0), Environment Interfaces (00.1), Coherence Orchestration (00.2)

**Planned Development Phases:**
1. **Core Interface APIs (01.1)** - Direct modulator interfaces (2-3 weeks)
2. **Composite Interface APIs (01.2)** - Combined primitive operations (3-4 weeks)
3. **Interface Protocols (01.3)** - System consistency protocols (2-3 weeks)

**Success Criteria:**
- All modulators, primitives, and patterns have operational interfaces
- APIs can be directly translated to code in multiple languages
- Physics domain successfully implements basic simulations using the APIs
- Dual-register understanding preserved across all interfaces
