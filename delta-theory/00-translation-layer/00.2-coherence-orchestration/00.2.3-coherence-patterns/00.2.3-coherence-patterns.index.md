# 00.2.3 - Coherence Patterns (index)

> Operational coherence patterns derived from modulator effects: Resilience (recovery coordination), Synchronization (temporal alignment), Persistence (memory preservation).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental coherence patterns that provide enhanced functionality for coherence orchestration operations, derived from modulator effects applied to coherence contexts:

- **Resilience:** Recovery coordination pattern for managing system adaptation (derived from λV modulator effects)
- **Synchronization:** Temporal alignment pattern for coordinating operations across time (derived from ∇S modulator effects)
- **Persistence:** Memory preservation pattern for maintaining information across contexts (derived from ψA modulator effects)

These patterns work together as enhanced coherence operations that extend the capabilities of coherence primitives through modulator-driven functionality. They operate in canonical integration: Resilience (adapt) ↔ Synchronization (coordinate) ↔ Persistence (preserve).

## Content Structure

| Category | Description | Key Elements | Polarity |
|----------|-------------|--------------|----------|
| Resilience Pattern | Recovery coordination enhancement | [[resilience.pattern\|Resilience (pattern)]] - λV derived | P- |
| Synchronization Pattern | Temporal alignment enhancement | [[synchronization.pattern\|Synchronization (pattern)]] - ∇S derived | P+ |
| Persistence Pattern | Memory preservation enhancement | [[persistence.pattern\|Persistence (pattern)]] - ψA derived | P0 |
| VSA Progression | Canonical modulator flow | λV (P-) → ∇S (P+) → ψA (P0) | P- → P+ → P0 |
| Primitive Enhancement | Extended capabilities | Recovery+, Phase+, Memory+ functionality |
| Pattern Integration | Coordination mechanisms | Resilience ↔ Synchronization ↔ Persistence |
| Operational Enhancement | Advanced functionality | Adaptive response, temporal coordination, information management |
| Modulator Coordination | Universal control | λV, ∇S, ψA effects across all patterns |

Each pattern provides technical and humane mappings, advanced operational semantics, modulator-driven functionality, domain manifestations, and integration with primitives.

## Key Principles

1. **Modulator Derivation (VSA Progression)**
   - Resilience (P-) derives from λV (Void) modulator effects
   - Synchronization (P+) derives from ∇S (Structure) modulator effects
   - Persistence (P0) derives from ψA (Awareness) modulator effects

2. **Primitive Enhancement**
   - All coherence patterns must enhance, not replace, primitive operations
   - Patterns provide optional enhancement - primitives remain functional independently
   - Pattern complexity emerges from modulator-primitive interactions

3. **Pattern Integration**
   - Patterns work in canonical integration: Resilience ↔ Synchronization ↔ Persistence (P- ↔ P+ ↔ P0)
   - Pattern integration enables sophisticated coherence orchestration scenarios
   - Modulator effects enable context-specific pattern adaptation
