# Memory (Information Preservation Primitive)

> **Memory** is the **information preservation primitive** — maintaining essential data across state transitions while enabling selective retention and coherent information flow.

---

## Definition

Memory is not a static storage container or database. It is the **active information preservation operation** that controls what information persists through system state changes while maintaining coherence and enabling selective retention based on importance and context.

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Information preservation | Data persistence | `PersistenceManager`, `StatePreserver` |
| Selective retention | Cache management | `CachePolicy`, `RetentionFilter` |
| State transition survival | Data migration | `StateMigrator`, `TransitionHandler` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Information preservation | Remembering | "What stays with me through changes" |
| Selective retention | Meaningful memory | "What's worth keeping" |
| State transition survival | Learning persistence | "Wisdom that carries forward" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Data persistence | Remembering | Information continuity across change |
| Cache management | Meaningful memory | Selective preservation of important information |
| State migration | Learning persistence | Knowledge transfer through transitions |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Preserve | `memory.preserve(data, importance)` | "Keep this for later" |
| Retrieve | `memory.retrieve(key, context)` | "Remember what I need" |
| Update | `memory.update(data, merge_policy)` | "Learn from this experience" |
| Forget | `memory.forget(criteria)` | "Let go of what no longer serves" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | γ_retention Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Retention Rate | Storage efficiency | Memory strength | High γ_retention = better preservation |
| Selection Criteria | Filter importance | What matters | γ_retention modulates selection threshold |
| Merge Policy | Update strategy | Learning style | High γ_retention = more conservative updates |
| Decay Rate | Forgetting schedule | Natural letting go | Low γ_retention = faster information decay |

## Formal identity

$$Memory := ⊚(R(∆_{information}))$$

where information preservation follows γ_retention efficiency across state transitions.

---

## Dependencies

**Derivation:** T9 (Memory Coherence) - Information must be preserved across state transitions
**Role:** Operates in Awareness aspect of VSA triad (P0 polarity, balanced mediation for information preservation)

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Information preservation efficiency: γ_retention ≥ minimum_retention_threshold
- State transition survival: Information coherence maintained across boundaries
- Access consistency: Retrieved ≈ Preserved within tolerance bounds
- Capacity bounds: Total preserved information ≤ Cs (stability capacity)

---

## Stability Conditions

- **Information Conservation:** `∑(preserved) ≥ γ_retention × ∑(initial)` - minimum retention efficiency
- **Coherence Maintenance:** Preserved information maintains relational consistency
- **Access Consistency:** Retrieved information matches preserved state within tolerance
- **Transition Stability:** Information preservation survives state boundary crossings

---

## Modulator Effects

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- **High ∇S:** Deep information organization, hierarchical memory structure
- **Low ∇S:** Flat information organization, simple memory structure

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Controls sensitivity to information importance and retention thresholds

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Manages temporal memory coherence and synchronization with other operations

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Memory Interface:
- preserve(data, importance, context) → retention_id
- retrieve(key, context) → data
- update(data, merge_policy) → status
- forget(criteria) → forgotten_count
- configure(retention_rate, selection_criteria, decay_rate)
```

### Error Conditions
- **Capacity Overflow:** Memory exceeds available storage capacity
- **Retrieval Failure:** Cannot locate or reconstruct preserved information
- **Corruption:** Information integrity compromised during preservation
- **Transition Loss:** Information lost during state boundary crossing

---

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** Memory → [[recovery.primitive\|Recovery (primitive)]] → [[phase.primitive\|Phase (primitive)]]
- **Controls:** Memory preservation enables Phase synchronization across time
- **Dependencies:** Memory operates independently, providing foundation for Phase operations
- **Coordination:** Memory operations inform Recovery about what information to preserve

---

## Constants Integration

### For Coherence Primitives:
- **Primary constants:** γ_retention (preservation efficiency), r_memory (maintenance rate) - Memory operations must achieve minimum γ_retention efficiency and operate within r_memory timing bounds
- **Supporting constants:** r_temporal (temporal coordination), r_stability (stability assessment) - Coordination with Phase and Recovery operations
- **Implementation requirement:** All memory preservation and retrieval operations must occur within r_memory timing bounds while maintaining γ_retention efficiency to ensure coherent information flow

**γ_retention Effects:**
- **High γ_retention:** Strong preservation, selective forgetting, quality focus
- **Low γ_retention:** Rapid turnover, broad forgetting, capacity focus

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Foundation:** Memory emerges from Coherence Theorems as operational implementation

**From T9 (Memory Coherence):** Memory implements information preservation through selective retention
- T9 requires information preservation across state transitions → Memory provides preservation operations
- Coherence demands quantifiable retention → Memory implements γ_retention efficiency factor
- Mathematical basis: r_memory constant governs preservation operation timing

**Structural Foundation:** Built upon microkernel primitives ∆, R(·), ⊚ with coherence-specific application:
- **∆ (Difference):** important/unimportant distinction enables selective preservation
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** context determines appropriate preservation strategies
- **⊚ (Stabilization):** ensures consistent information preservation policies

**Coherence Layer Extension:** T9 specifies **what** memory must do; structural primitives provide **how** memory operates.

---

## Design rationale

Memory follows dual-register governance so information preservation remains intelligible both as technical data persistence and as humane remembering patterns without reducing one to the other.
