# 00.2.2 - Coherence Primitives (index)

> Core coherence operations derived from structural primitives: Memory (information preservation), Phase (temporal synchronization), Recovery (stability restoration).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental coherence primitives that enable coherence orchestration operations, derived from the full structural primitive sequence (∆ → R(·) → ⊚) applied to coherence contexts:

- **Memory:** Information preservation primitive for maintaining data across state transitions
- **Phase:** Temporal synchronization primitive for coordinating timing across operations
- **Recovery:** Stability restoration primitive for managing perturbation responses

These primitives work together as the core coherence operations that implement temporal identity, memory preservation, and recovery coordination. They operate in canonical sequence: Memory (preserve) → Phase (synchronize) → Recovery (restore).

Each primitive provides technical and humane mappings, operational semantics, control interfaces, and domain manifestations.

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Derivation**
   - All coherence primitives derive from structural primitives (∆, R(·), ⊚)
   - Applied to coherence contexts: information/temporal/stability
   - Each primitive implements the full structural sequence in its domain

2. **Theorem Grounding (SVA Progression)**
   - Memory (P+) implements T9 (Memory Coherence) - information preservation
   - Recovery (P-) implements T8 (Recovery Stability) - stability discrimination
   - Phase (P0) implements T7 (Temporal Continuity) - temporal synchronization

3. **Coherence Orchestration**
   - Primitives follow canonical SVA sequence: Memory (P+) → Recovery (P-) → Phase (P0)
   - Coherence complexity emerges from structural simplicity through specialized application
   - No coherence operation can violate microkernel boundaries (ε, c, Cs)
