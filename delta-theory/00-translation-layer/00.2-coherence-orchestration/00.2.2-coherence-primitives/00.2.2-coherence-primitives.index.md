# 00.2.2 - Coherence Primitives (index)

> Core coherence operations derived from structural primitives: Recovery (stability restoration), Phase (temporal synchronization), Memory (information preservation).

---

## Module Overview

This module defines the three fundamental coherence primitives that enable coherence orchestration operations, derived from the full structural primitive sequence (R(·) → ∆ → ⊚) applied to coherence contexts:

- **Recovery:** Stability restoration primitive for managing perturbation responses
- **Phase:** Temporal synchronization primitive for coordinating timing across operations
- **Memory:** Information preservation primitive for maintaining data across state transitions

These primitives work together as the core coherence operations that implement recovery coordination, temporal identity, and memory preservation. They operate in canonical sequence: Recovery (restore) → Phase (synchronize) → Memory (preserve).

Each primitive provides technical and humane mappings, operational semantics, control interfaces, and domain manifestations.

## Key Principles

1. **Structural Derivation**
   - All coherence primitives derive from structural primitives (R(·), ∆, ⊚)
   - Applied to coherence contexts: stability/temporal/information
   - Each primitive implements the full structural sequence in its domain

2. **Theorem Grounding (VSA Progression)**
   - Recovery (P-) implements T7 (Recovery Stability) - stability discrimination
   - Phase (P+) implements T8 (Temporal Continuity) - temporal synchronization
   - Memory (P0) implements T9 (Memory Coherence) - information preservation

3. **Coherence Orchestration**
   - Primitives follow canonical VSA sequence: Recovery (P-) → Phase (P+) → Memory (P0)
   - Coherence complexity emerges from structural simplicity through specialized application
   - No coherence operation can violate microkernel boundaries (c, ε, Cs)
