# Phase (Temporal Synchronization Primitive)

> **Phase** is the **temporal synchronization primitive** — coordinating timing across operations while maintaining temporal identity and enabling coherent phase relationships between system components.

---

## Definition

Phase is not a static clock or timer. It is the **active temporal coordination operation** that controls timing relationships between system components while maintaining temporal identity coherence and enabling synchronized operations across distributed processes.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Temporal synchronization | Clock coordination | `TimeSync`, `PhaseAligner` |
| Identity persistence | Session management | `IdentityManager`, `ContinuityTracker` |
| Rhythm coordination | Heartbeat management | `HeartbeatCoordinator`, `RhythmSync` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Temporal synchronization | Being in rhythm | "Moving together in time" |
| Identity persistence | Staying yourself | "Remaining who you are across time" |
| Rhythm coordination | Natural timing | "Finding the shared beat" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Clock coordination | Being in rhythm | Temporal alignment across components |
| Session management | Staying yourself | Identity continuity through time |
| Heartbeat management | Natural timing | Rhythmic coordination of life processes |

## Interface Operations

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Synchronize | `phase.synchronize(components, reference)` | "Get everyone in rhythm" |
| Maintain | `phase.maintain(identity, interval)` | "Keep being yourself" |
| Coordinate | `phase.coordinate(operations, timing)` | "Move together smoothly" |
| Align | `phase.align(phases, tolerance)` | "Find the common beat" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | r_temporal Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|
| Sync Frequency | Coordination rate | Rhythm speed | High r_temporal = more frequent sync |
| Phase Tolerance | Timing precision | Rhythm flexibility | r_temporal sets minimum sync interval |
| Identity Refresh | Maintenance rate | Self-renewal pace | r_temporal governs identity maintenance |
| Drift Correction | Error adjustment | Getting back in sync | High r_temporal = faster drift correction |

## Formal identity

$$Phase := ⊚(R(∆_{temporal}))$$

where temporal synchronization follows r_temporal maintenance cycles and ψA phase coherence relationships.

---

## Dependencies

**Derivation:** T7 (Temporal Continuity) - Systems must maintain identity continuity across time intervals
**Role:** Operates in Awareness aspect of SVA triad (P0 polarity, balanced mediation for temporal coordination)

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Temporal identity persistence: identity(t+Δt) ≈ identity(t) within r_temporal bounds
- Phase coherence maintenance: ψA relationships preserved across synchronization cycles
- Synchronization frequency: sync_rate ≥ r_temporal minimum maintenance rate
- Drift correction capacity: phase_drift ≤ correction_capacity within timing bounds

---

## Stability Conditions

- **Temporal Identity:** `identity(t+Δt) ≈ identity(t)` within r_temporal maintenance intervals
- **Phase Coherence:** Synchronized components maintain phase relationships within tolerance
- **Rhythm Stability:** Coordination frequency remains consistent across operational cycles
- **Drift Bounds:** Phase drift stays within correction capacity of r_temporal maintenance

---

## Modulator Effects

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- **High ψA:** Tight phase coordination, precise timing, strong coherence
- **Low ψA:** Loose phase coordination, flexible timing, adaptive coherence

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- **High ∇S:** Deep temporal structure, hierarchical timing coordination
- **Low ∇S:** Flat temporal structure, simple timing coordination

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- Controls sensitivity to timing variations and synchronization thresholds

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Phase Interface:
- synchronize(components, reference_phase) → sync_status
- maintain(identity, refresh_interval) → maintenance_status
- coordinate(operations, timing_constraints) → coordination_result
- align(phase_sources, tolerance) → alignment_status
- configure(sync_frequency, phase_tolerance, drift_correction)
```

### Error Conditions
- **Desynchronization:** Components fall out of phase beyond tolerance
- **Identity Drift:** Temporal identity changes beyond maintenance capacity
- **Timing Conflict:** Incompatible timing requirements between operations
- **Phase Lock Failure:** Cannot establish or maintain phase relationships

---

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** [[Memory (primitive)]] → [[Recovery (primitive)]] → Phase
- **Controls:** Phase synchronization enables coordinated Recovery responses
- **Dependencies:** Requires preserved information from Memory for temporal identity
- **Coordination:** Phase timing provides temporal foundation for Memory and Recovery operations

---

## Constants Integration

### For Coherence Primitives:
- **Primary constants:** r_temporal (maintenance rate) - Phase operations must maintain temporal identity within r_temporal intervals
- **Supporting constants:** r_memory (memory coordination), r_stability (recovery timing) - Synchronization with Memory preservation and Recovery assessment cycles
- **Implementation requirement:** All phase synchronization and identity maintenance operations must occur within r_temporal timing bounds while coordinating through ψA modulator relationships to ensure coordinated temporal operations

**r_temporal Effects:**
- **High r_temporal:** More frequent synchronization, tighter temporal coordination
- **Low r_temporal:** Less frequent synchronization, looser temporal coordination

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Foundation:** Phase emerges from Coherence Theorems as operational implementation

**From T7 (Temporal Continuity):** Phase implements temporal identity persistence through active synchronization
- T7 requires identity continuity across time intervals → Phase provides temporal coordination operations
- Coherence demands active maintenance → Phase implements r_temporal maintenance cycles
- Mathematical basis: r_temporal constant governs identity maintenance timing, ψA provides phase coherence anchor

**Structural Foundation:** Built upon microkernel primitives ∆, R(·), ⊚ with coherence-specific application:
- **∆ (Difference):** synchronized/desynchronized distinction enables temporal coordination
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** temporal context determines appropriate synchronization strategies
- **⊚ (Stabilization):** ensures consistent temporal identity and phase relationships

**Coherence Layer Extension:** T7 specifies **what** phase must do; structural primitives provide **how** phase operates.

---

## Design rationale

Phase follows dual-register governance so temporal synchronization remains intelligible both as technical clock coordination and as humane rhythm patterns without reducing one to the other.
