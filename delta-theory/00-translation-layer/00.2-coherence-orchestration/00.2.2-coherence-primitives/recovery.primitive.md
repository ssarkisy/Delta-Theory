# Recovery (Stability Restoration Primitive)

> **Recovery** is the **stability restoration primitive** — discriminating between perturbations and stability while coordinating appropriate responses to maintain system coherence and enable adaptive resilience.

---

## Definition

Recovery is not a static error handler or backup system. It is the **active stability management operation** that discriminates between destabilizing and stabilizing influences while coordinating appropriate responses to restore coherence and maintain system resilience through perturbations.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Primitive concept | Network construct | Interface/API example |
|------------------|------------------|----------------------|
| Stability discrimination | Anomaly detection | `AnomalyDetector`, `StabilityMonitor` |

| Resilience management | Fault tolerance | `FaultHandler`, `ResilienceController` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Primitive concept | Humane construct | Example |
|------------------|------------------|---------|
| Stability discrimination | Sensing what helps vs hurts | "Knowing what supports vs undermines" |
| Response coordination | Healing response | "Coordinating recovery efforts" |
| Resilience management | Adaptive strength | "Growing stronger through challenges" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Anomaly detection | Sensing harm/help | Discrimination between stabilizing and destabilizing influences |
| Incident management | Healing response | Coordinated response to restore wellbeing |
| Fault tolerance | Adaptive strength | Resilience through appropriate response to perturbations |

### Core Functions

| Operation | Technical Implementation | Humane Implementation |
|-----------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Assess | `recovery.assess(perturbation, context)` | "Understand what's happening" |
| Discriminate | `recovery.discriminate(influence, threshold)` | "Know if this helps or hurts" |
| Respond | `recovery.respond(threat, strategy)` | "Take appropriate action" |

### Control Parameters

| Parameter | Technical Control | Humane Control | δ_recovery Effect |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|-------------------|

## Formal identity

$$Recovery := ⊚(R(∆_{stability}))$$

where stability restoration follows δ_recovery discrimination sensitivity and r_stability assessment cycles.

---

## Dependencies

**Derivation:** T8 (Recovery Stability) - Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability
**Role:** Operates in Void aspect of SVA triad (P- polarity, field-seeking for stability discrimination)

---

## Conditions / Invariants

- Discrimination sensitivity: |stabilizing - destabilizing| ≥ δ_recovery for reliable distinction
- Assessment frequency: stability_checks ≥ r_stability minimum assessment rate
- Response capacity: recovery_actions ≤ Cs (stability capacity) bounds
- Restoration effectiveness: restored_stability ≥ target_stability within tolerance

---

## Stability Conditions

- **Discrimination Accuracy:** `|stabilizing - destabilizing| ≥ δ_recovery` for reliable distinction
- **Response Timeliness:** Recovery actions initiated within r_stability assessment intervals
- **Restoration Effectiveness:** System returns to stable state within recovery capacity bounds
- **Adaptive Learning:** Recovery strategies improve based on perturbation patterns and outcomes

---

## Modulator Effects

### λV (Void Resonance Threshold)
- **High λV:** Selective perturbation sensitivity, precise recovery activation
- **Low λV:** Broad perturbation sensitivity, rapid recovery activation

### ∇S (Structure Differentiation Gradient)
- **High ∇S:** Deep response structure, hierarchical recovery strategies
- **Low ∇S:** Flat response structure, simple recovery strategies

### ψA (Awareness Phase Coherence Anchor)
- Manages temporal coordination of recovery operations with other primitives

---

## Implementation Guidelines

```
Recovery Interface:
- assess(perturbation, context) → stability_assessment
- discriminate(influence, sensitivity) → discrimination_result
- respond(threat, response_strategy) → response_status
- restore(current_state, target_stability) → restoration_result
- configure(sensitivity, response_speed, restoration_target)
```

### Error Conditions
- **Misclassification:** Incorrectly identifying stabilizing influence as destabilizing (or vice versa)
- **Response Delay:** Recovery action initiated too late to prevent stability loss
- **Overreaction:** Excessive response to minor perturbation causing additional instability
- **Recovery Failure:** Unable to restore system to stable state within capacity limits

---

## Related Primitives

- **Sequence:** [[memory.primitive|Memory (primitive)]] → Recovery → [[phase.primitive|Phase (primitive)]]
- **Controls:** Recovery responses complete the coherence orchestration cycle
- **Dependencies:** Requires temporal coordination from Phase and preserved information from Memory
- **Feedback:** Recovery operations inform Memory about what information to preserve for future recovery

---

## Constants Integration

### For Coherence Primitives:
- **Primary constants:** δ_recovery (discrimination sensitivity), r_stability (assessment rate) - Recovery operations must discriminate between influences with δ_recovery precision and assess stability within r_stability intervals
- **Supporting constants:** r_temporal (temporal coordination), r_memory (information access), γ_retention (learning from recovery) - Coordination with Phase timing and Memory preservation for effective recovery
- **Implementation requirement:** All recovery discrimination and response operations must occur within r_stability timing bounds while maintaining δ_recovery sensitivity to ensure effective stability restoration and system resilience

**δ_recovery Effects:**
- **High δ_recovery:** Precise discrimination, selective responses, quality focus
- **Low δ_recovery:** Broad discrimination, rapid responses, coverage focus

**r_stability Effects:**
- **High r_stability:** More frequent assessments, faster response timing
- **Low r_stability:** Less frequent assessments, slower response timing

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Foundation:** Recovery emerges from Coherence Theorems as operational implementation

**From T8 (Recovery Stability):** Recovery implements stability discrimination through perturbation management
- T8 requires discrimination between perturbations and stability → Recovery provides discrimination operations
- Coherence demands coordinated responses → Recovery implements response coordination with r_stability timing
- Mathematical basis: δ_recovery constant governs discrimination sensitivity, r_stability governs assessment timing

**Structural Foundation:** Built upon microkernel primitives ∆, R(·), ⊚ with coherence-specific application:
- **∆ (Difference):** stabilizing/destabilizing distinction enables recovery discrimination
- **R(·) (Relational Embedding):** context determines appropriate recovery strategies
- **⊚ (Stabilization):** ensures consistent recovery policies and stable restoration outcomes

**Coherence Layer Extension:** T8 specifies **what** recovery must do; structural primitives provide **how** recovery operates.

---

## Design rationale

Recovery follows dual-register governance so stability restoration remains intelligible both as technical fault management and as humane healing patterns without reducing one to the other.
