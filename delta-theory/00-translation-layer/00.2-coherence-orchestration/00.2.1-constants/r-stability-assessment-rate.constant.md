# r_stability — Stability Assessment Rate (constant)

> Base rate of stability assessment operations — defines the fundamental frequency at which systems evaluate stability versus perturbation conditions to maintain coherent recovery coordination.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `r_stability`
- Conceptual name: `Stability Assessment Rate`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: Base operational rate for stability versus perturbation evaluation activities

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T8 (Recovery Stability) — "Systems must discriminate between perturbations and stability"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T8 Requirement:** Systems must distinguish destabilizing from stabilizing influences to orchestrate recovery
2. **Mathematical Implication:** Stability discrimination requires ongoing assessment → requires periodic evaluation
3. **Constant Emergence:** r_stability emerges as the fundamental rate governing stability assessment operations
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents the minimal operational tempo required for timely recovery coordination

**Traceback:** `A0 → T2+A0 → T5 → T8 → r_stability` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** T8 requires stability discrimination → discrimination requires ongoing assessment → r_stability provides the base rate for assessment operations → enables timely recovery coordination

## Formal identity

$$r_{stability} = \frac{1}{\tau_{assessment}}$$

where $\tau_{assessment}$ is the characteristic time scale for stability assessment operations.

## Scope & invariance

- **Domain:** All recovery coherence operations requiring stability assessment
- **Invariance:** Holds across domains implementing T8 (Recovery Stability)
- **Precision:** Domain instances determine specific assessment frequencies and evaluation intervals
- **Scaling:** Rate may scale with system complexity and environmental volatility

## Architecture Examples

**Real-world coherence systems where r_stability defines stability assessment frequency:**

### **Load Balancer Health Checks**
- **Health Check Intervals:** Regular assessment of backend server stability (typically every 5-30 seconds)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains service availability coherence by detecting and routing around failed instances

### **Financial Risk Management Systems**
- **Portfolio Risk Assessment:** Continuous evaluation of market stability and portfolio exposure (typically every 1-15 minutes)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves investment coherence by detecting destabilizing market conditions

### **Infrastructure Monitoring Systems**
- **System Health Monitoring:** Regular assessment of server, network, and application stability (typically every 30s-5min)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains operational coherence by detecting and responding to system perturbations

### **Autonomous Vehicle Control Systems**
- **Environmental Stability Assessment:** Continuous evaluation of road conditions and obstacle stability (typically 10-100ms intervals)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves navigation coherence by discriminating between stable and unstable environmental conditions

### **Immune System Response**
- **Pathogen Detection Cycles:** Regular assessment of biological system stability and threat detection (typically hours to days)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains biological coherence by discriminating between self and non-self, stable and destabilizing influences

### **Organizational Performance Management**
- **Team Health Assessment:** Regular evaluation of team stability and performance indicators (typically weekly/monthly)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves organizational coherence by detecting and addressing team dysfunction or instability

**r_stability Application:** Defines the maximum safe interval between stability assessments. Waiting longer than r_stability → delayed detection of instability and poor recovery coordination. Assessing faster → better responsiveness but higher overhead.

## Mathematical Properties

### Expression
```
r_stability ∈ ℝ⁺
r_stability > 0 (positive definite)
∂r_stability/∂t = 0 (time-invariant)
```

### Relationships
- **Lower bound:** Must allow stability assessment completion
- **Upper bound:** Must enable timely detection of instability
- **Stability:** Constant across recovery coherence contexts

### Operational Constraints
- **Coherence operations** must respect r_stability timing for recovery operations
- **Temporal/Memory/Recovery operations** must maintain stability assessment within r_stability bounds
- **Modulator effects** cannot violate r_stability requirements

---

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Coherence Operations
- **Temporal coherence operations:** Stability assessment provides foundation for temporal identity persistence
- **Memory coherence operations:** Stability assessment ensures memory preservation occurs in stable contexts
- **Recovery coherence operations:** r_stability directly governs discrimination timing between perturbations and stability

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon closure geometry timing (related to π) and asymmetric differentiation (related to φ)
- **Interface extension:** Coordinates with interface constants (κ, ι, σ) for boundary stability assessment
- **Coherence coordination:** Works with r_temporal and r_memory to provide complete coherence orchestration timing

### Violation Consequences
- **Too fast:** Unnecessary assessment overhead, resource waste, potential system performance degradation from over-monitoring
- **Too slow:** Delayed detection of instability, poor recovery coordination, system failures from undetected perturbations
- **Variable:** Inconsistent recovery response, unpredictable stability detection, system instability from timing inconsistency
