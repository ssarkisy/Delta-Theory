# r_temporal — Temporal Continuity Maintenance Rate (constant)

> Base rate of temporal coherence maintenance operations — defines the fundamental frequency at which system identity must be renewed to maintain temporal coherence across time intervals.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `r_temporal`
- Conceptual name: `Temporal Continuity Maintenance Rate`
- Conceptual value: `conceptual` (domain instances carry numbers/units)
- Definition: Base operational rate for temporal identity coherence preservation

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Theorem Source:** T7 (Temporal Continuity) — "Systems must maintain identity continuity across time intervals"

**Derivation Logic:**
1. **T7 Requirement:** Systems must preserve temporal identity despite continuous change and time passage
2. **Mathematical Implication:** Identity preservation requires active maintenance → requires periodic renewal operations
3. **Constant Emergence:** r_temporal emerges as the fundamental rate governing temporal identity maintenance operations
4. **Invariant Nature:** Represents the minimal operational tempo required for sustainable temporal coherence

**Traceback:** `A0 → T3+A0 → T6 → T7 → r_temporal` — derivation chain from foundational axiom

**Flow:** T7 requires continuous temporal identity → identity must be actively maintained → r_temporal provides the base rate for maintenance operations → enables sustainable temporal coherence

## Formal identity

$$r_{temporal} = \frac{1}{\tau_{coherence}}$$

where $\tau_{coherence}$ is the characteristic time scale for temporal identity maintenance operations.

## Scope & invariance

- **Domain:** All temporal coherence operations requiring active maintenance
- **Invariance:** Holds across domains implementing T7 (Temporal Continuity)

## Architecture Examples

**Real-world coherence systems where r_temporal defines temporal identity maintenance frequency:**

### **Database Transaction Systems**
- **Checkpoint Intervals:** Regular commit frequency to maintain transaction coherence (typically every 1-10 minutes)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves data consistency coherence by ensuring temporal identity of transactions across time

### **Authentication Token Systems**
- **Token Refresh Rates:** Regular renewal of authentication tokens to maintain session coherence (typically every 15-60 minutes)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains user identity coherence by preventing temporal identity decay through token expiration

### **Distributed System Heartbeats**
- **Heartbeat Frequencies:** Regular status updates to maintain cluster coherence (typically every 1-30 seconds)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves system identity coherence by ensuring temporal continuity of node participation

### **Biological Circadian Rhythms**
- **Circadian Cycle Maintenance:** Regular biological rhythm reinforcement to maintain temporal identity (24-hour cycles)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains biological coherence by preserving temporal identity across daily cycles

### **Financial Market Data Feeds**
- **Price Update Frequencies:** Regular market data updates to maintain temporal coherence (typically every 100ms-1s)
- **Coherence Function:** Preserves market identity coherence by ensuring temporal continuity of price discovery

### **Personal Identity Practices**
- **Self-Reflection Rhythms:** Regular identity-affirming activities to maintain personal coherence (daily/weekly practices)
- **Coherence Function:** Maintains personal identity coherence by preserving temporal continuity of self-concept

**r_temporal Application:** Defines the maximum safe interval between identity maintenance operations. Waiting longer than r_temporal → temporal identity decay and coherence loss. Maintaining faster → better coherence but higher overhead.

## Mathematical Properties

### Expression
```
r_temporal ∈ ℝ⁺
r_temporal > 0 (positive definite)
∂r_temporal/∂t = 0 (time-invariant)
```

### Relationships
- **Lower bound:** Must allow identity maintenance completion
- **Upper bound:** Must prevent temporal identity decay
- **Stability:** Constant across temporal coherence contexts

### Operational Constraints
- **Coherence operations** must respect r_temporal timing for identity preservation
- **Memory/Recovery operations** must coordinate with r_temporal for temporal consistency
- **Modulator effects** cannot violate r_temporal requirements

---

## Implementation Notes

### Usage in Coherence Operations
- **Temporal coherence operations:** r_temporal directly governs identity maintenance timing
- **Memory coherence operations:** Temporal maintenance provides foundation for memory preservation across time
- **Recovery coherence operations:** Temporal identity provides stable foundation for recovery coordination

### Relationship to Other Constants
- **Microkernel foundation:** Built upon closure geometry timing (related to π) and asymmetric differentiation (related to φ)
- **Interface extension:** Coordinates with interface constants (κ, ι, σ) for temporal boundary maintenance
- **Coherence coordination:** Works with r_memory and r_stability to provide complete coherence orchestration timing

### Violation Consequences
- **Too fast:** Unnecessary maintenance overhead, resource waste, potential system performance degradation from over-maintenance
- **Too slow:** Temporal identity decay, coherence loss, system failures from identity discontinuity
- **Variable:** Inconsistent identity maintenance, unpredictable coherence, system instability from timing inconsistency
