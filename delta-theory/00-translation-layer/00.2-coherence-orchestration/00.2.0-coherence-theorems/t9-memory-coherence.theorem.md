# T9 — Memory Coherence (theorem)

> Information must be preserved across state transitions — patterns maintain coherent accessibility through system state changes.

---

## Statement

**Information must be preserved across state transitions** — patterns maintain coherent accessibility through system state changes. For any system S with state transitions $S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow S_n$, memory coherence requires:
- $F_{memory} = ⊚(R(∆_{state\_info}))$ where $∆_{state\_info}$ preserves information across state boundaries
- $R(∆_{state\_info})$ embeds information patterns in state-independent relational context
- $⊚$ ensures recursive information conservation across state transitions
- The resulting Form maintains accessible information coherence through state changes

**Scope:** Applies to all information patterns requiring persistence across system state transitions beyond interface operational boundaries.

**00.2 Irreducibility:** State coherence coordination is irreducible at the coherence orchestration level — cannot be reduced to interface boundary operations alone.

---

## Primitive Derivation

**Traceback:** `∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → State-Coherent Forms` — why primitive operations require memory coherence

**Foundation:** From T4 (Interface Conservation) + state extension → memory coherence necessity for state-persistent information preservation
**Flow:** ∆ detects state information changes → R(·) embeds information patterns in state-independent relations → ⊚ achieves recursive information conservation across state transitions
**Result:** Theorem emerges to preserve information coherence across state boundaries, extending T4's boundary conservation to state dimension

---

## Proof

**Given:** T4 (Interface Conservation) and state transition requirements

**To Prove:** Information must be preserved across state transitions

**Proof:**
1. **From T4:** Interface operations must preserve difference across boundaries: $C(F_{in}) = C(F_{out}) + C(∆State) + C(Transform)$
2. **State transition requirement:** Systems operate through state sequences $S_1 \rightarrow S_2 \rightarrow ... \rightarrow S_n$
3. **Information persistence need:** Information must remain accessible across state transitions
4. **State as boundary crossing:** Each state transition represents information crossing temporal-state boundary
5. **If state information fails:** Information becomes inaccessible → violates T4 across state dimension
6. **Therefore:** Information must be preserved across state transitions to satisfy T4 across state boundaries □

**Corollaries:**
- State information persistence is logically necessary for system coherence across state changes
- Memory coherence requires recursive state-independent conservation mechanisms

## Formal Properties

### Mathematical Expression
- State information function: $F_{memory} = ⊚(R(∆_{state\_info}))$
- Conservation constraint: $Info(S_i) \cong Info(S_j) \pm \epsilon$ for state transitions $S_i \rightarrow S_j$
- Coherence requirement: $\forall S_i \in [S_1, S_n]: retrieve(I, S_i) \sim retrieve(I, S_1) \pm \epsilon$ (information preserved within bounds)

### Logical Structure
- **Conditional:** If system undergoes state transitions, then memory coherence is necessary
- **Necessary condition:** State information preservation required for persistent system operation
- **Scope limitation:** Within coherence orchestration capacity and state boundaries

---

## Dependencies & scope

- **Derived from:** T4 (Interface Conservation) + state extension
- **Requires:** System state transition operation requirements
- **Applies to:** All information patterns requiring persistence across system state transitions beyond interface operational boundaries
- **Exceptions:** Ephemeral information with explicitly transient state lifecycle

---

## Implementation Notes

### Technical Implementation
- Memory coherence requires transactional state management
- Information persistence must be atomic across state transitions
- State consistency requires distributed coordination mechanisms

### Design Implications
- System design must balance memory coherence with state transition performance
- Information state should be externally auditable for consistency verification
- Error recovery must preserve essential information characteristics across state failures

## Relationship to Other Principles

### Theorem Relationships
- **T4 Foundation:** Extends boundary conservation to state dimension
- **T7 Bridge:** Memory enables temporal identity coherence
- **T8 Support:** Information persistence enables recovery coherence

### Axiom Relationships
- **A0 Foundation:** Preserves existential information differences across states
- **T3 Dependency:** Leverages recursive closure for state information persistence

## Examples (concept)

- **Database transaction:** Information remains consistent across commit/rollback state transitions - memory coherence through ACID properties
- **Personal memory:** Life experiences remain accessible through major life changes - memory coherence through narrative continuity
- **Version control:** Code history preserved across branch merges - memory coherence through change tracking
