# 00.2 - Coherence Orchestration (index)

> **Coherence orchestration sublayer** — Manages recovery coordination, temporal identity, and memory preservation to maintain system coherence across stability, time, and state transitions.

---

## Module Overview

The Coherence Orchestration sublayer extends the interface layer with specialized components for maintaining system coherence across stability, temporal, and state challenges. This sublayer provides the mathematical and operational foundation for systems that must preserve identity and functionality despite change.

The coherence layer includes:
- **Coherence Theorems:** Extended theorems (T7, T8, T9) that govern recovery, temporal, and memory coherence
- **Coherence Constants:** Operational constants (r_stability, δ_recovery, r_temporal, r_memory, γ_retention) that control coherence timing and efficiency
- **Coherence Primitives:** Specialized primitives (Recovery, Phase, Memory) for coherence operations
- **Coherence Patterns:** Enhanced patterns (Resilience, Synchronization, Persistence) that provide advanced coherence functionality

This coherence layer enables complete orchestration of system coherence across all operational dimensions.

## Key Principles

### **Coherence Orchestration**
- **Recovery Coherence (T7):** Systems discriminate between perturbations and stability for effective recovery coordination
- **Temporal Coherence (T8):** Systems maintain identity continuity across time intervals through active maintenance
- **Memory Coherence (T9):** Systems preserve information across state transitions with quantifiable retention

### **Operational Constants**
- **Recovery Constants:** r_stability, δ_recovery define operational parameters for stability assessment and discrimination
- **Temporal Constants:** r_temporal defines maintenance rates for temporal identity preservation
- **Memory Constants:** r_memory, γ_retention define maintenance rates and efficiency factors for information preservation
- **Coordination:** All constants work together to provide complete coherence orchestration timing

### **Core Operations**
- **Recovery Primitive:** Stability restoration and perturbation management with δ_recovery discrimination and r_stability assessment
- **Phase Primitive:** Temporal synchronization and coordination with r_temporal maintenance
- **Memory Primitive:** Information preservation across state transitions with γ_retention efficiency and r_memory maintenance

### **Enhanced Functionality**
- **Resilience Pattern:** Adaptive response strategies through λV modulator effects on Recovery primitive
- **Synchronization Pattern:** Hierarchical temporal coordination through ∇S modulator effects on Phase primitive
- **Persistence Pattern:** Coherent information management through ψA modulator effects on Memory primitive

### **Architectural Role**
- **Extends Interface Layer:** Builds upon interface discrimination, conservation, and identity capabilities
- **Enables Implementation:** Provides mathematical foundation for coherence orchestration systems
- **Supports Applications:** Enables recovery coordination, temporal identity, and memory systems
