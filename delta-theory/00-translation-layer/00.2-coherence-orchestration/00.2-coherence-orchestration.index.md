# 00.2 - Coherence Orchestration (index)

> **Coherence orchestration sublayer** — Manages temporal identity, memory preservation, and recovery coordination to maintain system coherence across time, state transitions, and perturbations.

---

## Module Overview

The Coherence Orchestration sublayer extends the interface layer with specialized components for maintaining system coherence across temporal, state, and perturbation challenges. This sublayer provides the mathematical and operational foundation for systems that must preserve identity and functionality despite change.

The coherence layer includes:
- **Coherence Theorems:** Extended theorems (T7, T8, T9) that govern temporal, recovery, and memory coherence
- **Coherence Constants:** Operational constants (r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability, γ_retention, δ_recovery) that control coherence timing and efficiency
- **Coherence Primitives:** Specialized primitives (Memory, Phase, Recovery) for coherence operations
- **Coherence Patterns:** Enhanced patterns (Synchronization, Persistence, Resilience) that provide advanced coherence functionality

This coherence layer enables complete orchestration of system coherence across all operational dimensions.

## Key Principles

### **Coherence Orchestration**
- **Temporal Coherence (T7):** Systems maintain identity continuity across time intervals through active maintenance
- **Recovery Coherence (T8):** Systems discriminate between perturbations and stability for effective recovery
- **Memory Coherence (T9):** Systems preserve information across state transitions with quantifiable retention

### **Operational Constants**
- **Maintenance Rates:** r_temporal, r_memory, r_stability define operational tempos for coherence preservation
- **Efficiency Factors:** γ_retention, δ_recovery define mathematical relationships for coherence operations
- **Coordination:** All constants work together to provide complete coherence orchestration timing

### **Core Operations**
- **Memory Primitive:** Information preservation across state transitions with γ_retention efficiency
- **Phase Primitive:** Temporal synchronization and coordination with r_temporal maintenance
- **Recovery Primitive:** Stability restoration and perturbation management with δ_recovery discrimination

### **Enhanced Functionality**
- **Synchronization Pattern:** Advanced temporal coordination through ψA modulator effects on Phase primitive
- **Persistence Pattern:** Hierarchical information management through ∇S modulator effects on Memory primitive
- **Resilience Pattern:** Adaptive response strategies through λV modulator effects on Recovery primitive

### **Architectural Role**
- **Extends Interface Layer:** Builds upon interface discrimination, identity, and conservation capabilities
- **Enables Implementation:** Provides mathematical foundation for coherence orchestration systems
- **Supports Applications:** Enables temporal identity, memory systems, and recovery coordination
