# Zero

> In Delta Theory, "Zero" is not numeric 0 or an ontological primitive. It names a difference that is below the current resolution threshold ε — operationally non‑actionable and indistinguishable for a given interface or domain.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Zero** denotes absence of manifested difference:
- |∆| < ε for the relevant interface
- Will not pass gates or bind into form
- Context-dependent (ε varies by domain)

Key aspects:
- Not a primitive or constant
- Not numeric 0 in arithmetic
- Not Void (which is opaque outside)
- Marks boundary between manifested and unmanifested difference

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Resolution | Threshold | `Epsilon`, `MinVal` |
| Filter | Gate | `Filter`, `Cutoff` |
| Noise | Sub-threshold | `Noise`, `Jitter` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Resolution | Notice limit | "Too small to see" |
| Filter | Attention gate | "Doesn't register" |
| Noise | Background | "Just noise" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Threshold | Notice | What we can detect |
| Gate | Filter | What gets through |
| Sub-threshold | Background | What fades away |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Quantum limit | Natural threshold |
| Networks | Noise floor | Living boundary |
| Cognition | Subliminal | Below awareness |
| Systems | Error margin | Natural limit |

## Scale Effects

How Zero manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum limits create fundamental detection thresholds
- **Example:** Planck-scale phenomena and energy gap cutoffs

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention limits define what registers as significant
- **Example:** Subliminal stimuli and background noise filtering

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed limits create information cutoffs
- **Example:** Event horizons and cosmic signal limits

**Scale transitions:** At each scale, "Zero" manifests as specific threshold or cutoff relative to fundamental limits.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Sets minimal feature detection |
| Void | Defines opacity floor |
| Awareness | Bounds coherence recognition |

Zero marks the boundary between manifested and unmanifested difference, defining what can be operationally distinguished within any given context.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Zero | [[void.glossary|Void (glossary)]] | Zero is below threshold; Void is opaque outside |
| Zero | [[infinite.glossary|Infinite (glossary)]] | Zero is under-resolution; Infinite is beyond bounds |
| Zero | [[structure.glossary|Structure (glossary)]] | Zero lacks manifestation; Structure has boundaries |
