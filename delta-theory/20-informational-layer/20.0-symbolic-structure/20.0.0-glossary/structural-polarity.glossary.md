> The structure-building pole in a [[polarity.glossary|Polarity (glossary)]] system that represents difference intake, self-contained forms, and autonomous structure generation through satisfied differential states.

## Definition

Structural Polarity (P+) represents the structure-building, self-contained aspect of a polarity system that operates from differential satiety to create autonomous forms. It emerges from [[delta.primitive|Primitive Difference]] through relational embedding and manifests when systems have sufficient difference accumulation to build internal structure rather than seek external resources. Contains P-(n+1) at its core through nested counter-rotation.

**Note on Energy-Difference Relationship:** In domain-specific manifestations, accumulated differences appear as various forms of energy (potential, kinetic, chemical, etc.). Energy is thus a domain projection of the more fundamental ∆ substrate—the capacity to make differences manifest as measurable work or transformation potential.

## Scale Effects

How Structural Polarity manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Minimum difference generation | Quantum fluctuation |
| λV | Interface activation threshold | Potential barrier |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Coherent change perception | Noticeable shift |
| ∇S | Structural differentiation | Clear distinction |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Large-scale autonomous structure formation through self-contained dynamics
- **Example:** Star formation, planetary systems, and galactic structure building

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, structural polarity may present as its polarity opposites due to fundamental limits.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Generates autonomous forms and self-contained systems |
| Void | Creates internal coherence and difference consolidation |
| Awareness | Maintains stable structural patterns and form recognition |

Structural Polarity is the **structure-building** dimension of the triadic system, creating autonomous forms through difference consolidation.
