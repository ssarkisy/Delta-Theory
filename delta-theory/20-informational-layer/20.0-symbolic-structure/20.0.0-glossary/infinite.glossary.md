# Infinite

> In Delta Theory, "infinite" is a limit concept, not a constant. It names unbounded continuation (e.g., recursion depth, measure) rather than a realizable state inside a bounded system.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Infinite** is a boundary idealization:
- Mathematical limit notion: quantities without finite bound
- Conceptual contrast to operational limits (ε, c)
- Not an object or value; a reasoning tool

Systems are bounded by anchors and capacities, showing:
- Below resolution: "Zero" (|∆| < ε)
- Within capacity: distinguishable structure
- Beyond capacity: saturation/opacity

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Limit | Asymptotic bound | `MAX_VALUE`, `∞` |
| Saturation | Overflow | `Saturate`, `Clip` |
| Capacity | Resource bound | `Limit`, `Quota` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Limit | Beyond reach | "Goes on forever" |
| Saturation | Overwhelm | "Too much to handle" |
| Capacity | Natural bounds | "All we can take" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Asymptote | Horizon | What we can't reach |
| Overflow | Overwhelm | When bounds break |
| Quota | Limit | What contains us |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Singularity | Natural limit |
| Networks | Buffer overflow | Living boundary |
| Cognition | Stack overflow | Mind's edge |
| Systems | Resource exhaustion | Natural capacity |

## Scale Effects

How Infinite manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum infinity appears as Planck-scale boundaries
- **Example:** Energy divergences requiring cutoff procedures

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention limits create subjective infinity
- **Example:** Information overload and cognitive saturation

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed creates event horizons and causal boundaries
- **Example:** Observable universe limits and cosmic horizons

**Scale transitions:** At each scale, "infinite" manifests as specific boundary or saturation relative to fundamental limits.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Theoretical unbounding |
| Void | Opacity beyond capacity |
| Awareness | Coherence limitation |

"Infinite" appears as saturation or divergence relative to anchors, not as an attained state.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Infinite | Zero | Infinite is unbounded; Zero is below resolution |
| Infinite | Finite | Infinite has no bounds; Finite is measurable |
| Infinite | Recursive Depth | Infinite is limit concept; Recursive Depth is operational |
