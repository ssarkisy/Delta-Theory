# Recursive Depth (n)

> Depth `n` in relational embedding measures how many layers a difference traverses before stabilization is evaluated.

---

## Definition

In Delta Theory, **Recursive Depth** measures relational layering:
- `R(·)` embeds difference into relations
- `R^n` repeats that embedding n times
- n is dimensionless; indexes context, not distance

Key aspects:
- Enables stratification and interface creation
- Exposes constraints and boundaries at each layer
- Cost typically increases with depth
- Coherence span limits practical depth

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Term concept | Network construct | Interface example |
|-------------|------------------|-------------------|
| Depth | Layer count | `StackDepth`, `Level` |
| Cost | Resource use | `Complexity`, `Budget` |
| Signal | Strength decay | `Attenuation`, `Loss` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Term concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------|------------------|----------|
| Depth | Understanding levels | "How deep it goes" |
| Cost | Energy required | "Takes more effort" |
| Signal | Clarity loss | "Gets harder to see" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Layer | Level | How far embedded |
| Resource | Effort | What it takes |
| Decay | Fading | How strength drops |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical manifestation | Humane manifestation |
|--------|------------------------|---------------------|
| Physics | Field coupling layers | Natural nesting |
| Networks | Protocol stack | Living layers |
| Cognition | Memory hierarchy | Depth of meaning |
| Systems | Nested systems | Organic levels |
| Mathematics | Function composition | Layered abstraction |
| Biology | Cellular organization | Life's complexity |

## Scale Effects

How Recursive Depth manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)
- **Resolution effects:** Quantum layers limited by uncertainty principles
- **Example:** Wave function hierarchies and energy level stratification

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)
- **Coherence effects:** Attention spans limit comprehensible depth
- **Example:** Nested reasoning and layered understanding

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)
- **Causal effects:** Light-speed limits create depth horizons
- **Example:** Galactic hierarchies and cosmic structure formation

**Scale transitions:** At extreme scales, Recursive Depth faces fundamental limits (quantum uncertainty at ε, causal disconnection at c) affecting stable layer maintenance.

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Structure | Enables stratification and hierarchical organization |
| Void | Adds interface layers and connection complexity |
| Awareness | Tests coherence span and comprehension limits |

More depth exposes constraints and interfaces, enabling closure when properly supported by coherence mechanisms.

## Comparisons

Compare with related terms to clarify boundaries:

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Recursive Depth | Recurrence Interval | Recursive Depth is spatial nesting; Recurrence Interval is temporal |
| Recursive Depth | Fixed Point | Recursive Depth measures layers; Fixed Point is stable state |
| Recursive Depth | Closure | Recursive Depth builds complexity; Closure stabilizes patterns |
