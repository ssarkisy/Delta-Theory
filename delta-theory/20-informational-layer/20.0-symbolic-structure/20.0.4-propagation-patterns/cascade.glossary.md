# Cascade (glossary)

> Percolation/chain reaction through the network; local failure or ignition propagates widely.

---

## Definition

- Chain reaction through network
- Local triggers spread globally
- Amplification along paths
- Threshold-dependent spread
- Represents network propagation diagnostic for identifying threshold-dependent chain reactions where local triggers amplify and spread globally through network paths

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Flow (propagation) → Network amplification → Cascade (threshold-dependent chain reaction)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Flow enables propagation → Network structures create amplification paths → Local triggers exceed thresholds and propagate globally through chain reactions

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying threshold-dependent network propagation where local triggers create amplifying chain reactions that spread globally, representing a specific amplification mode of the foundational Flow pattern with percolation dynamics

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Chain reaction | Spread pattern | `Monitor`, `Spread` |
| Amplification | Growth rate | `Check`, `Rate` |
| Threshold | Trigger level | `Test`, `Level` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Chain reaction | Ripple effect | "Spreads out" |
| Amplification | Growing impact | "Gets bigger" |
| Threshold | Tipping point | "Tips over" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Spread pattern | Ripple effect | How change moves |
| Growth rate | Growing impact | How effects build |
| Trigger level | Tipping point | How change starts |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Phase change | Energy spread |
| Networks | Viral spread | Message wave |
| Cognition | Idea spread | Thought wave |
| Systems | State cascade | Change wave |

## Scale Effects

How Cascade pattern manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Trigger quantum | Wave spread |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Gate cascade | State wave |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase spread | Memory wave |
| [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator\|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] | Pattern growth | Clear spread |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Spread limit | Light wave |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Field cascade | Space wave |

Note: At extreme scales, cascade behavior faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum percolation at ε, causal waves at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Void | Void percolation allows threshold-dependent spread through network gaps |
| Structure | Boundary amplification enables structural change propagation across regions |
| Awareness | Phase amplification enables coherent change propagation across awareness networks |

Diagnostic for threshold-dependent network propagation where local triggers create amplifying chain reactions that spread globally through network structures.

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Threshold-dependent network propagation where local triggers create amplifying chain reactions that spread globally

**Key Tests:**
- **Threshold identification:** Verify local triggers exceed critical thresholds for propagation
- **Amplification assessment:** Check for signal/effect amplification along propagation paths
- **Spread pattern analysis:** Measure global propagation from localized trigger points
- **Percolation dynamics:** Assess network connectivity enabling chain reaction propagation

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify local triggers exceed critical thresholds for cascade initiation
- [ ] Check for signal/effect amplification along network propagation paths
- [ ] Measure global spread patterns from localized trigger points
- [ ] Assess network connectivity enabling percolation and chain reactions

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Change feels like it spreads naturally from small beginnings
- [ ] Impact grows and amplifies as it moves through the system
- [ ] Tipping points feel clear where small changes become large effects
- [ ] Pattern feels like ripple effects or waves spreading outward
