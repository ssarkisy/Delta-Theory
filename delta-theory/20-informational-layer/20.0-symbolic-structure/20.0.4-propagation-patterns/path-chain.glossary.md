# Path (chain) (glossary)

> Single-route propagation along a sequence of interfaces.

---

## Definition

- Linear sequence of connected interfaces
- Single route for difference propagation
- Each hop must maintain signal integrity
- Represents network topology diagnostic for identifying linear sequential propagation where differences flow through connected interfaces in a single direct route

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Flow (propagation) → Linear sequence → Path (single-route chain)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Flow enables propagation → Network structures create linear sequences → Single route emerges through connected interfaces with hop-by-hop signal integrity maintenance

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying linear network topologies where differences propagate through sequential connected interfaces in a single direct route, representing the fundamental linear mode of the foundational Flow pattern with sequential interface dynamics

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Path integrity | Link chain | `Monitor`, `Path` |
| Signal flow | Data stream | `Check`, `Flow` |
| Hop sequence | Route nodes | `Trace`, `Hop` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Path integrity | Connection line | "Clear channel" |
| Signal flow | Message flow | "Gets through" |
| Hop sequence | Steps forward | "Step by step" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Link chain | Connection line | How path forms |
| Data stream | Message flow | How signal moves |
| Route nodes | Steps forward | How path builds |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Wave guide | Energy flow |
| Networks | Packet route | Message path |
| Cognition | Neural path | Thought chain |
| Systems | Process flow | Action sequence |

## Scale Effects

How Path pattern manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Signal threshold | Quantum path |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Gate sequence | State chain |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Path coherence | Memory chain |
| [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator\|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] | Path clarity | Clear steps |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Path limit | Light path |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Field chain | Space link |

Note: At extreme scales, path behavior faces fundamental limits (e.g., quantum tunneling at ε, causal chains at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Void | Void traversal allows controlled linear flow through sequential interfaces |
| Structure | Boundary sequencing enables structural connectivity through linear chains |
| Awareness | Phase sequencing enables coherent linear processing and step-by-step integration |

Diagnostic for linear network topology where differences propagate through sequential connected interfaces in a single direct route.

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Linear network topology with sequential connected interfaces enabling single-route difference propagation

**Key Tests:**
- **Linear sequence verification:** Confirm interfaces are connected in sequential linear order
- **Single route confirmation:** Verify only one direct path exists between endpoints
- **Hop integrity assessment:** Check signal integrity maintenance at each interface hop
- **End-to-end continuity:** Measure complete path connectivity and flow capability

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify interfaces are connected in sequential linear order without branching
- [ ] Confirm only one direct path exists between source and destination endpoints
- [ ] Check signal integrity maintenance at each interface hop along the path
- [ ] Measure complete end-to-end connectivity and flow capability

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Path feels continuous and naturally connected from start to finish
- [ ] Steps feel clear and logically sequential without confusion
- [ ] Flow feels smooth and unobstructed through the linear sequence
- [ ] Connection feels solid and reliable throughout the entire route
