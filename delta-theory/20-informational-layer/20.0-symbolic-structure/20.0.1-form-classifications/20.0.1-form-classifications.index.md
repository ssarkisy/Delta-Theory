# 20.0.1 - Form Classifications (index)

> Diagnostic classes over `Form` based on operational invariants and thresholds. Observational schema; not kernel.

---

## Module Overview

Form Classifications provide diagnostic categories for assessing the stability and coherence of Forms based on their recursive closure properties. These classifications enable systematic evaluation of form stability, identifying failure modes, and predicting behavior under perturbation.

The classification framework includes:
- **Stable Form:** Fully stabilized across embedding layers with persistent identity
- **Apparent Form:** Superficially coherent but containing hidden instabilities
- **Collapsed Form:** Failed stabilization with difference dissipation
- **Pseudo Form:** Performative coherence without genuine closure support

## Content Structure

| Class | Description | Key Diagnostic |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| [[stable-form.glossary\|Stable Form (glossary)]] | Fully stabilized across embedding layers | Persists under perturbation |
| [[apparent-form.glossary\|Apparent Form (glossary)]] | Looks coherent but hides instability | Hidden layer collapse |
| [[collapsed-form.glossary\|Collapsed Form (glossary)]] | Fails stabilization completely | Difference dissipation |
| [[pseudo-form.glossary\|Pseudo Form (glossary)]] | Performative/illusory coherence | No closure support |

Each classification provides:
- Technical and humane diagnostic criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Failure mode patterns
- Operational tests
