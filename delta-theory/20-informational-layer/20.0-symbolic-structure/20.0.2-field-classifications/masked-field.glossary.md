# Masked Field (classification)

> Appears transparent but hides Voids, thresholds, or filters that distort observation and inference.

---

## Definition

- Interfaces exist, but gates/filters bias or truncate visibility
- Some closure predicates cannot be evaluated from Field perspective
- Hidden layers can cause unexpected failures
- Represents field coherence compromise where contextual transparency is selectively obscured by interface distortions

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Field (contextual coherence) → Masked Field (compromised transparency through selective filtering)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Field provides contextual coherence → λV modulators create selective gates → contextual transparency becomes compromised through filtering

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying field coherence degradation where contextual transparency is compromised by selective interface filtering rather than complete field failure

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Masking | Hidden state | `Probe`, `Reveal` |
| Filter | Gate bias | `Threshold`, `Filter` |
| Hidden layer | Concealed path | `Trace`, `Debug` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Masking | Hidden truth | "Something's missing" |
| Filter | Selective view | "Only shows part" |
| Hidden layer | Deeper issue | "More underneath" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Hidden state | Hidden truth | What we can't see |
| Gate bias | Selective view | How view is filtered |
| Concealed path | Deeper issue | What's underneath |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Hidden variable | Masked interaction |
| Networks | Hidden node | Filtered connection |
| Cognition | Memory mask | Selective awareness |
| Systems | Hidden state | Concealed process |

## Scale Effects

How Masked Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Hidden quantum | Wave collapse |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | State filter | Energy mask |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase mask | Hidden pattern |
| [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator\|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] | Structure filter | Boundary mask |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal mask | Hidden horizon |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Field filter | Dark matter |

Note: At extreme scales, masking can become indistinguishable from natural limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, cosmic horizons at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Void | Curated void concealment through selective filtering |
| Structure | Selective boundary formation creating partial visibility |
| Awareness | Compromised coherence with selective pattern recognition |

Diagnostic for partial field coherence where selective filtering compromises contextual transparency without complete field breakdown.

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Selective interface filtering compromising field transparency while maintaining basic coherence

**Key Tests:**
- **Filter variation:** Adjust λV thresholds to reveal hidden behaviors
- **Resolution increase:** Enhance detection to find concealed structures
- **Path cross-validation:** Test multiple observation routes for consistency
- **Boundary probing:** Test interface edges to identify filtering mechanisms

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Vary λV modulator settings to reveal hidden interface behaviors
- [ ] Increase resolution beyond ε threshold to detect concealed structures
- [ ] Cross-validate through multiple observation paths for consistency
- [ ] Probe boundary conditions to identify filtering mechanisms

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Look for missing pieces in the overall pattern
- [ ] Question initial assumptions about what should be visible
- [ ] Check multiple perspectives to identify blind spots
- [ ] Trust intuitive sense that something is being concealed
