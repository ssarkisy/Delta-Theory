# Sparse Field (classification)

> Under‑sampled or under‑resolved regime in which differences fall below ε and fail to register.

---

## Definition

- Sampling/resolution too low; many signals are sub‑ε
- Interfaces present but cannot accumulate enough evidence for closure
- Pattern recognition fails due to insufficient data
- Represents field coherence breakdown where signal density falls below detection thresholds, preventing meaningful discrimination

---

## Primitive Foundation

**Traceback:** ∆ (Difference) → Field (contextual coherence) → Sparse Field (sub-threshold signal density preventing discrimination)

**Flow:** ∆ generates differences → Field provides contextual coherence → signal density falls below ε threshold → contextual discrimination fails due to insufficient evidence

**Role:** Diagnostic classification for identifying field coherence breakdown where signal density is too low to cross detection thresholds, preventing the field from accumulating sufficient evidence for meaningful discrimination

## Dual‑register mapping

### Technical (network/computational)

| Diagnostic concept | Network construct | Test example |
|-------------------|------------------|--------------|
| Sparsity | Low density | `Sample`, `Count` |
| Resolution | Detail level | `Measure`, `Scale` |
| Evidence | Data points | `Collect`, `Test` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Diagnostic concept | Humane construct | Example |
|-------------------|------------------|----------|
| Sparsity | Too thin | "Not enough there" |
| Resolution | Detail loss | "Can't make it out" |
| Evidence | Weak signal | "Barely noticeable" |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Diagnostic meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| Low density | Too thin | What's missing |
| Detail level | Clarity | What we can see |
| Data points | Signals | What we can use |

### Domain Examples

| Domain | Technical test | Humane test |
|--------|---------------|-------------|
| Physics | Under-sampling | Weak signal |
| Networks | Sparse data | Thin connection |
| Cognition | Memory gaps | Faint impression |
| Systems | Missing points | Weak pattern |

## Scale Effects

How Sparse Field manifests differently at various scales:

### Micro Scale (ε-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ε | Sub-quantum | Wave loss |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Gate miss | State gap |

### Human Scale (ψA-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| ψA | Phase gap | Pattern miss |
| [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator\|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] | Structure loss | Boundary gap |

### Cosmic Scale (c-bounded)

| Constant | Effect | Example |
|----------|--------|---------|
| c | Causal gap | Light loss |
| [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator\|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] | Field sparsity | Void dominance |

Note: At extreme scales, sparsity can become indistinguishable from fundamental limits (e.g., quantum uncertainty at ε, cosmic voids at c).

## Ontological Role

| Domain | Role |
|--------|------|
| Void | Void dominance where signal density cannot overcome void resonance |
| Structure | Boundary detection fails due to insufficient differentiation density |
| Awareness | Coherence formation prevented by inadequate phase binding evidence |

Diagnostic for field detection failure where signal density falls below thresholds needed for meaningful contextual discrimination.

## Comparisons

| This term | Related term | Key distinction |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|
| Sparse Field | [[saturated-field.glossary\|Saturated Field (glossary)]] | Too little signal vs too much signal |
| Sparse Field | [[transparent-field.glossary\|Transparent Field (glossary)]] | Sub-threshold vs clear visibility |
| Sparse Field | [[masked-field.glossary\|Masked Field (glossary)]] | Insufficient data vs selective filtering |

## Diagnostic Framework

**Core Detection Pattern:** Field detection failure due to signal density falling below discrimination thresholds

**Key Tests:**
- **Threshold measurement:** Verify signal density falls below ε detection limits
- **Evidence accumulation:** Check for insufficient data for pattern closure
- **Resolution testing:** Increase sampling density to restore discrimination
- **Gate sensitivity:** Adjust λV thresholds to capture weak signals

---

## Diagnostic Checklist

**Technical tests:**
- [ ] Verify signal density falls below ε detection thresholds
- [ ] Check for insufficient evidence accumulation for pattern closure
- [ ] Increase sampling resolution to test for signal recovery
- [ ] Adjust λV gate sensitivity to capture weak signals

**Humane tests:**
- [ ] Pattern feels too faint or barely noticeable to register
- [ ] Awareness cannot gather enough evidence for clear recognition
- [ ] Signal requires more attention or closer examination to detect
- [ ] Pattern recognition feels incomplete due to missing information
