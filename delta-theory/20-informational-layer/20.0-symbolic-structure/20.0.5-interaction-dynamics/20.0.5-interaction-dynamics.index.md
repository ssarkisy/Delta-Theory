# 20.0.5 - Interaction Dynamics (index)

> Observational dynamics at interfaces and within loops; tie to anchors (ε, c, π/φ) and VSA (λV, ∇S, ψA).

---

## Module Overview

Interaction Dynamics provide diagnostic categories for assessing behavioral patterns at interfaces and within network loops. These dynamics enable systematic evaluation of phase relationships, component interactions, and stability conditions across different scales and contexts.

The dynamics framework includes:
- **Resonance:** Phase alignment creating amplification and synchronization
- **Interference:** Phase mixing affecting pattern stability and coherence
- **Harmony:** Component coherence enabling flexible alignment and cooperation
- **Dissonance:** Phase tension creating productive conflict and differentiation

## Content Structure

| Dynamic | Description | Key Diagnostic |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| [[resonance.glossary\|Resonance (glossary)]] | Amplified response to matching frequencies | Harmonic coherence |
| [[interference.glossary\|Interference (glossary)]] | Superposition of waves | Constructive/destructive patterns |
| [[harmony.glossary\|Harmony (glossary)]] | Balanced integration of differences | Stable relational embedding |
| [[dissonance.glossary\|Dissonance (glossary)]] | Unresolved differential tension | Unstable relational embedding |

Each dynamic provides:
- Technical and humane diagnostic criteria
- Scale-dependent manifestations
- Phase behavior patterns
- Stability conditions

Note: Jamming/Saturation is covered under [[saturated-field.glossary|Saturated Field (glossary)]].
