# Theorem (template)

> Use this template for derived ontological truths that are proven from foundational axioms. Unlike axioms, theorems must include logical derivation from more fundamental principles.

---

## LLM Usage Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is template guidance - DO NOT copy instructional text into final files.

### Usage Instructions:
- Replace ALL `<placeholder>` text with actual content
- Remove unused sections completely rather than leaving empty
- Include complete formal proof from foundational axioms
- Maintain mathematical notation and proper linking
- Add implementation examples relevant to the theorem's domain

### Section Requirements:
**Core Sections (All Theorems):** Statement → Primitive Derivation → Proof → Dual-register mapping → Domain Manifestations → Dependencies & scope → Related structures
**Optional Extensions:** Formal Properties, Implementation Notes, Relationship to Other Principles, Examples (concept)

### Important Notes:
- **Microkernel theorems (T1, T2, T3)** work within existing microkernel constants/boundaries and do NOT derive new ones
- **Interface theorems (T4, T5, T6)** DO derive interface-specific constants (σ_conservation, κ_discrimination, ι_identity) as mathematical expressions of their requirements
- **Only include "Emergent Constants/Boundaries" sections** if the theorem actually derives documented constants/boundaries in the architecture
- **Verify derivation claims** - constants must exist in the actual architecture before claiming derivation

### Template vs Final File Example:

**IN TEMPLATE:**
```markdown
## Statement

- Core principle derived from foundational axiom(s)
- Operational scope and boundaries (e.g., "at resolution ε", "within capacity Cs")
```

**IN FINAL FILE (for T1):**
```markdown
## Statement

- Difference is inherently directional at resolution ε: ∆(A→B) ≠ ∆(B→A) in any meaningful embedding.
```

> One‑line statement of the derived ontological truth.

## Statement

- Core principle derived from foundational axiom(s)
- Operational scope and boundaries (e.g., "at resolution ε", "within capacity Cs")
- Clear statement of the necessity relationship

---

## Primitive Derivation

*Compact trace to primitive difference — provides intuitive context for the formal proof*

**Traceback:** [[delta.primitive|∆]] → [[relational-embedding.primitive|R(·)]] → [[stabilization-closure.primitive|⊚]] → F — why primitive operations require this theorem

**Foundation:** From A0 → this necessity
**Flow:** How ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ → F generates the requirement
**Result:** Theorem emerges to preserve primitive operation coherence

---
