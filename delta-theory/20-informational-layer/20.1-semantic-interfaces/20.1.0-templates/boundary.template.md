# Boundary (template)

> Use this template for operational limits and system constraints that define feasible operational envelopes.

---

## LLM Usage Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is template guidance - DO NOT copy instructional text into final files.

### Usage Instructions:
- Replace ALL `<placeholder>` text with actual content
- Remove unused sections completely rather than leaving empty
- Focus on operational constraints and system limits
- Current boundaries (ε, c, Cs) are foundational; future boundaries may be derived
- Maintain dual-register mapping for accessibility

### Section Requirements:
**Core Sections (All Boundaries):** Definition → Dual-register mapping → Domain Mapping → Formal identity → Anchor role → Scope & invariance → Interplay with VSA
**For Derived Boundaries Only:** Add Primitive Derivation section after Definition
**Optional Extensions:** Critical Implications, Relationship to Other Boundaries, Examples

### Current Delta Theory Boundaries:
- **ε — Difference Resolution Quantum:** Foundational boundary (no primitive derivation)
- **c — Difference Propagation Limit:** Foundational boundary (no primitive derivation)
- **Cs — Stability Capacity:** Foundational boundary (no primitive derivation)

## Title

`# <Symbol> — <Conceptual name> (boundary)`

> One‑line statement of the operational limit or constraint role.

---

## Definition

- Symbol: `<Symbol>`
- Conceptual name: `<Conceptual name>`
- Definition: operational limit or constraint that bounds system behavior (e.g., resolution limit; capacity threshold)

---

## Primitive Derivation (if derived boundary)

*For derived boundaries only. Current boundaries (ε, c, Cs) omit this section.*

**Traceback:** [[delta.primitive|Delta (primitive)]] → [[relational-embedding.primitive|RelationalEmbedding (primitive)]] → [[stabilization-closure.primitive|Stabilization (Closure) (primitive)]] → F — why primitive operations require this boundary

**Flow:** How ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ operations generate this constraint
**Foundation:** From A0/T1/T2/T3 logical necessity
**Role:** What operational limits this boundary enforces

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the boundary into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Boundary concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| <concept>        | <technical target>        | `<API example>`     |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Boundary concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|------------------|---------------------------|---------|
| <concept>        | <felt experience>         | <lived example> |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| <tech term>   | <felt term> | <shared meaning>  |

## Formal identity

- Defining relationships or operational thresholds, e.g.:
  - Minimum viable signal: $\varepsilon_{signal} \geq \varepsilon_{threshold}$
  - Maximum capacity: $Load \leq C_{s,max}$

---

## Anchor role

- What this boundary constrains (resolution, speed, capacity, etc.)
- How it defines operational envelopes for system behavior
- Critical implications for system design and stability

---

## Scope & invariance

- Domain(s) where this boundary applies
- How boundary values are determined in different contexts
- Guidance for boundary management and design margins

---

## Interplay with VSA

- How this boundary interacts with [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] / [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] / [[psi-a-awareness-phase-coherence-anchor.modulator|ψA — Awareness (Aiza) Phase Coherence Anchor (modulator)]] control parameters
- Boundary awareness and adaptive management

---

## Critical Implications

**System Design:**
- How this boundary affects architecture and capacity planning
- Design patterns for staying within boundary limits
- Warning signs when approaching boundary conditions

**Failure Modes:**
