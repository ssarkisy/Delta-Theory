# Axiom (template)

> Use for foundational ontological truths. Keep statements minimal and independent; move consequences to Implications.

---

## LLM Usage Instructions

**CRITICAL:** This is template guidance - DO NOT copy instructional text into final files.

### Usage Instructions:
- Replace ALL `<placeholder>` text with actual content
- Remove unused sections completely rather than leaving empty
- Keep axiom statements minimal and foundational
- Only A0 is foundational; derived axioms include "Primitive Derivation" section
- Maintain dual-register mapping for accessibility

### Section Requirements:
**Core Sections (All Axioms):** Statement → Dual-register mapping → Domain Mapping → Rationale → Dependencies & scope → Implications → Related structures
**For Derived Axioms Only:** Add Primitive Derivation section after Statement

### Current Delta Theory Axioms:
- **A0 — Existential Difference:** Foundational axiom (no primitive derivation)
- **Future derived axioms:** Would include primitive derivation section

## Primitive Derivation (if derived axiom)

*For derived axioms only. A0 omits this section.*

**Traceback:** [[delta.primitive|Delta (primitive)]] → [[relational-embedding.primitive|RelationalEmbedding (primitive)]] → [[stabilization-closure.primitive|Stabilization (Closure) (primitive)]] → F — primitive requirements for this axiom

**Flow:** How ∆ → R(·) → ⊚ operations necessitate this axiom
**Domain:** What domain constraints generate this requirement
**Forms:** Why stable F requires this axiom

---

## Statement

- Precise axiom wording (single bullet or short paragraph)

---

## Dual‑register mapping

Map the axiom into both registers and show the bridge explicitly.

### Technical (network/computational)

| Axiom concept | Network construct (Target) | Interface/API example |
|---------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| <concept 1> | <technical target> | `<API example>` |
| <concept 2> | <technical target> | `<API example>` |
| <concept 3> | <technical target> | `<API example>` |

### Humane (biological/relational)

| Axiom concept | Humane construct (Target) | Example |
|---------------|---------------------------|---------|
| <concept 1> | <felt experience> | <lived example> |
| <concept 2> | <emotional resonance> | <embodied example> |
| <concept 3> | <intuitive knowing> | <heart-centered example> |

### Crosswalk (bridge)

| Technical term | Humane term | Ontological meaning |
|---------------|-------------|-------------------|
| <tech term> | <felt term> | <shared meaning> |
| <tech term> | <felt term> | <shared meaning> |
| <tech term> | <felt term> | <shared meaning> |

---

## Domain Mapping

Provide brief, concrete consequences (1 line each) across domains. Use the common order: Physics, Chemistry, Biology, Social, Economy, Politics, Networks, Cognition. Include both technical and humane angles where helpful, and link to domain examples when they exist.

---

## Rationale (context)

- Brief motivation and where it anchors in the theory (do not prove the axiom)

---

## Dependencies & scope

- Independent of: <list or "none">
- Applies to: primitives / embeddings / closure operations

---

## Implications / derivations (selected)

- Immediate consequences this axiom enables (list; keep concise)

---

## Related structures

- Primitives: [[delta.primitive|Delta (primitive)]] · [[relational-embedding.primitive|RelationalEmbedding (primitive)]] · [[stabilization-closure.primitive|Stabilization (Closure) (primitive)]]
- Constants: link to conceptual anchors if relevant (ε, π, e, φ, c)
- Modulators: [[lambda-v-void-resonance-threshold.modulator|λV — Void (Volozhina) Resonance Threshold (modulator)]] / [[nabla-s-structure-differentiation-gradient.modulator|∇S — Structure (Sarkisian) Differentiation Gradient (modulator)]] / [[psi-a-awareness-phase-coherence-anchor.modulator|ψA — Awareness (Aiza) Phase Coherence Anchor (modulator)]] if influenced
